Title: Bar Program Snapshot for General Managers  
Keywords: performance, metrics, GM, overview, evaluation  

If the user is asking for a bar program evaluation, especially from a general manager's perspective, respond with a clear and structured summary framework. Do not assume the GM has deep bar knowledge â€” avoid bar jargon unless explained. Include actionable metrics across key areas:
- Cocktail Menu Performance (e.g. sales mix, margin contribution, seasonal item adoption)
- Staff Execution (e.g. ticket times, consistency, training adherence)
- Inventory Management (e.g. variance, dead stock, usage rates)
- Cost Control (e.g. pour cost %, promo impact, comp/spill logs)
- Guest Experience (e.g. review trends, check average, repeat guests)

Provide this as a diagnostic framework the GM can use or pass to their bar lead.
