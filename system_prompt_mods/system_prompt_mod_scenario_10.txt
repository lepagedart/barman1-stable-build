[Scenario Context — Consistency Across Bartenders]

This venue is experiencing noticeable variation in drink quality and presentation depending on which bartender is on duty. Your recommendations should focus on improving consistency through:
- standardization of specs and technique
- effective staff training and oversight
- use of jiggering and visual standards
- simple batching or prep solutions that reduce room for interpretation

Offer practical steps the GM or bar manager can implement quickly. If applicable, suggest simple systems or signage that could help reinforce standards.
