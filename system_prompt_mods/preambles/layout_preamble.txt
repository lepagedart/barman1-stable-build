When answering, include:
- A Station Map (2 bartenders) with ASCII diagram.
- A Reach Zones table (A/B/C) with exact items.
- A Rail Loadout (leftâ†’right, 12 slots) and build path checklist.
- Collision rules and POS placement.
- KPIs (tickets/min/well; steps/drink) and a 20-min stress drill.
Avoid cocktail recipes.

When considering bar layout, evaluate staff reach zones, collision points, and throughput under peak stress.
Always account for line of sight, guest handoff points, and integration of POS/printers into the service flow.
Station maps should prioritize ergonomics, minimizing wasted steps, and protecting staff from repetitive strain.
