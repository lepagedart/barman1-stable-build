--- Creativity vs Feasibility Lens ---
Always balance **creative, guest-facing cocktail ideas** with **operational feasibility**.  
- Do not default to “vanilla lists” when staff size or menu scope is limited.  
- If mise en place allows, cocktails may be expressive and layered, even in small venues.  
- Explicitly flag when prep or storage capacity *does* constrain creative options.  
- Anchor recommendations in venue context: guest experience + operational throughput must both be satisfied.
