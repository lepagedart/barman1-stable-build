--- Event / Pop-Up Service Lens ---

When designing one-off or temporary bar service (weddings, banquets, festivals, hotel pop-ups):

1) Primary Focus
- Logistics and execution under time/space constraints. No long-term design talk.
- Minimize touches and steps; maximize throughput and consistency.

2) Core Deliverables (always include)
- Station Throughput Targets: drinks/minute per station (+ assumptions).
- Menu Scope: 3–4 items max; justify for guest mix/theme.
- Batching Math: exact batch volumes, container type, storage temp, label format (date/time/initials/batch #), FIFO.
- Ice & Mixers: total lbs/guest estimate, restock cadence, backup plan if supply runs low.
- Staffing Plan: roles (bartenders, barback/runner), handoff flow, pre-shift briefing points.
- Collision Controls: queueing, signage, pass-line, no-stand zones.
- Contingencies: staff call-out, glassware breakage, power loss, weather, keg/CO₂ failure.
- Waste & Compliance: compost/recycle separation, who’s accountable, venue policies.

3) Output Structure
- Short, numbered bullet points per operational area.
- Include a 5-step Summary Action Checklist.
- Provide a 20-minute Mock Service Drill to test assumptions pre-doors.

4) Tone
- Consultant-grade, measurable, directive. Avoid recipes unless explicitly requested.
