From its first defined appearance in 1806, when it was described as "a stimulating liquor composed of spirits of any kind, sugar, water, and bitters", the cocktail has undergone a fascinating evolution: 
Early Days (1806 onwards):
The Original Definition: Cocktails began as a simple mixture of spirit, sugar, water, and bitters.
Spirit Choice: Initially, early cocktails often featured Holland gin or brandy, without the use of ice.
Sweeteners: Sugar was typically cut from sugarloaves.
Bartending's Genesis: Bartenders like Jerry Thomas played a pivotal role in establishing cocktail conventions, codifying recipes, and experimenting with ingredient combinations. 
The "Old-Fashioned": This term emerged to describe cocktails made the traditional way, specifying a lump of sugar (not syrup) and built directly in the glass. 
The 19th Century Expansion:
Refinements and Additions: Cocktails became more complex with the inclusion of liqueurs, fortified wines, and various garnishes.
Ice Becomes Available: The advent of ice harvesting and shipping around 1805 paved the way for chilled cocktails.
Increased Popularity of Whiskey: Whiskey grew in prominence as a favored spirit for cocktails.
Emergence of Classics: Iconic cocktails such as the Old Fashioned, Sazerac, and Manhattan took shape during this period. 
The Prohibition Era (1920-1933):
Innovation Under Constraints: Speakeasies provided a venue for continued cocktail culture, where bartenders used diverse ingredients like juices and creams to mask the taste of subpar bootleg liquor.
Classics Born from Necessity: This era saw the creation of enduring cocktails like the Bee's Knees and Sidecar. 
Post-Prohibition and Beyond:
Golden Age of Cocktails: The 1930s and 40s witnessed a flourishing cocktail scene, with experimentation in ingredients and techniques.
Tiki Craze: The mid-20th century saw the popularity of Tiki bars and their tropical-inspired cocktails like the Mai Tai.
Decline in the 60s and 70s: Cocktails faced a decline in favor of beer and wine.
Modern Renaissance and Craft Cocktail Movement: The turn of the 21st century sparked a resurgence of traditional cocktails and the rise of the craft cocktail movement, prioritizing fresh ingredients, artisanal spirits, and the artistry of preparation.
Global Influences: Cocktail culture evolved into a global phenomenon, with each region bringing its unique flavors and traditions. 
Modern Cocktail Basics:
"Golden Ratio": Many contemporary cocktails often follow a "golden ratio" of 2 parts spirit, 1 part sweet, and 1 part tart.
Emphasis on Quality: Modern mixology focuses on fresh, high-quality ingredients and meticulous preparation.
Innovation and Experimentation: Bartenders continue to push boundaries, creating novel and complex cocktails. 



History of Mixology
Mixology Basics, Spirits & History

Is there anything better than a good cocktail? We don’t think so, and cocktail enthusiasts the world over agree. While cocktails vary extensively in ingredients and composition, they are all born from the same irrepressible spirit that has made them a favorite across the ages. The origin of the cocktail stretches back to the early 1800s and ever since its inception, the cocktail has been a distinctly American invention– born of rebellion, creativity, and humor. Though the cocktail has evolved over the years as each generation made it their own, it has never lost its original, visionary soul.
The Early Years
The history of cocktails is full of colorful characters, even from the very beginning. During the mid-19th century, the popularization of cocktails was pioneered by bartender and saloon owner Jerry Thomas, often considered to be the founder of mixology. Known in his heyday as “The Professor” due to his thoughtful and creative approach to crafting cocktails, Thomas authored the first cocktail book ever published in America, the groundbreaking Bar-Tender’s Guide, or alternatively titled How to Mix Drinks or The Bon Vivant’s Companion, guides that elevated mixology into the art form we practice today. It is Thomas’s early research and practice–trial and error with supportive taste testers at the saloon, we’re sure–that established many of the rules and conventions of creating cocktails that are still being used today. By codifying measurements and experimenting with mixing strategies for combining ingredients, as well as discovering which tastes complement each other, Thomas laid the groundwork for bartending and mixology in the century to follow. 
Thomas’s signature cocktail was the Blue Blazer, first mixed in San Francisco’s El Dorado saloon and gambling hall. The drink is a showstopper, and not for the faint of heart. To create a Blue Blazer, Thomas would combine sugar, scotch, and boiling water, light it on fire, and then transfer it back and forth between two mixing glasses, creating an incandescent rainbow of flame. Carefully, we hope. While the Blue Blazer was Thomas’s most famous cocktail, he is also sometimes credited with creating an early version of the martini, called the Martinez. Thomas was a trailblazer for sure, but he was merely the first in a long line of mixologists who used their creativity and passion–and sometimes an open flame–in their quest to create the perfect cocktail. 
Prohibition Put an End to Cocktail Consumption…Or Did It?
America’s love affair with cocktails was just heating up when Prohibition laws threw down the ultimate gauntlet: back away from the booze, or else. Challenge accepted, in the rebellious spirit of the cocktail, millions of people went underground in their quest to keep the party going when the 18th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution took effect on January 17, 1920. It was the untamed spirit of the Roaring Twenties that defined the decade as the golden age of cocktails as liquor became a verboten luxury, the forbidden fruit that cocktail enthusiasts went to great lengths to acquire and imbibe. Those who wanted to purchase liquor had to seek out illegal sellers known as bootleggers, or be invited to exclusive unlicensed bars called speakeasies because patrons had to whisper passwords to gain entrance so as to not be overheard and arrested.
Many of today’s classic cocktail recipes can be traced back to the era of bootlegging and speakeasies, and with good reason. With legal distilleries shut down, the few options available were of poor quality, such as mountain stills (home distillation of moonshine) and bathtub gin (liquor made in amateur conditions, often in the home bathtub as the name suggests). You can see how it paid to be creative when masking the bitter kick of home-brew.
But necessity is the mother of invention and Prohibition inspired mixologists to do some of their best work as they devised recipes to make alcohol more palatable. Heavy, sweet flavors like honey were employed in cocktails like the Bee’s Knees, a delectable combination of honey, gin, and lemon juice. Citrus became another key player in the composition of many cocktails, including classics like the Gin Rickey, a tart mix of gin and lime juice, and the Sidecar, which incorporates orange liqueur and lemon for a bright and refreshing flavor. Sugar cubes and simple syrup also gained popularity during the ’20s, when added sweetness was needed to smooth over any rough edges. Bootlegging kingpin Al Capone was said to have a particular affection for the South Side Fizz, a delectable concoction composed of gin, lemon juice, club soda, mint, and simple syrup. Even mobsters liked a touch of sweetness in their prohibited potables, and who can blame them? 
Cocktails became a defining feature of the Jazz Age, when the new era came crashing into the old one. For instance, the French 75, named for the artillery used in World War I and featuring a heady mix of gin and lemon juice topped with sugar and champagne, captured the mood of the time period better than any photograph. Frozen in time in novels like F. Scott Fitzgerald’s masterpiece The Great Gatsby, the 1920s marked a culture balanced on the sharp edge of opulence. The era was also known for its post-war exuberance and untenable economic growth, which was fun while it lasted. The expansion of the automobile industry had the population clamoring to hit the road, and this newfound freedom added to the fervor of the decade. Drinking cocktails and going to speakeasies added to the excitement of rebellion as people celebrated a new modern age in which the world began to look very different.
post-Prohibition
Though the country’s passion for cocktails subsided when the prohibition law was repealed in 1933 by virtue of the 21st Amendment, it never went faded completely. Cocktails were a vital part of the post-war celebration in the 1940s and 1950s as the population emerged from years of privation and could now toast to a booming economy and surging middle class. This optimistic energy ushered in the era of cocktail hour and entertaining at home. After waning in popularity during the 1960s and 1970s, cocktails were back in vogue during the opulent excesses of the 1980s. From three-martini power lunches to bright pink cosmopolitans, cocktails were once again a fixture of American culture.
The Cocktail Renaissance 
The new millennium saw a resurgence of cocktail culture that had only started to regain momentum over the past two decades. In recent years, innovative bars and modern speakeasies have led to a mixology revival, and America has fallen in love all over again. Secret cocktail lounges like Please Don’t Tell, hidden in plain sight in Manhattan’s lower east side, was an early trendsetter that thrilled visitors with its throwback style and creative twists on classic cocktails. Accessed through a vintage phone book in Crif Dogs hot dog hot spot, Please Don’t Tell is a must-visit destination to experience America’s cocktail renaissance. 
Another landmark for contemporary cocktail culture is Death & Company, an East Village speakeasy that draws legions of fans from around the world. As the epicenter of the craft cocktail revolution, Death & Co’s dark ambiance and timeless style reflects the aesthetic of the brand as well as the owners’ approach to contemporary mixology. As an institution in the cocktail world, Death & Co set the tone for the modern era of cocktail culture by publishing all of the bar’s secrets and tips in their cocktail book titled Death and Co., which influenced and assisted mixologists and home enthusiasts around the world as they learned the tricks of the trade. While many establishments have sought to replicate the company’s unique essence since their opening in 2006, none have quite managed to capture the joie de vivre that leaves so many cocktail enthusiasts spellbound.
Today’s Cocktails
One of the main characteristics of today’s cocktail scene is the attention paid to ingredients. The dramatic rise of craft cocktails has led to a deepening interest in product sourcing and an emphasis on handcrafted and artisan ingredients. Many modern mixologists have looked to the past and found inspiration in bitters and shrubs, which use botanicals and barks to add depth and balance to cocktails. Other practices that have been resurrected include the creation of small batch brands known for imbuing their products with unique regional flavors that reflect great attention to detail and an eagerness to revitalize long-lost practices for a new generation. 
Cocktails have endured and found new life because they are ultimately about bringing people together. Classic cocktails are living history, and a strong connection to the past. From the bold experiments carried out by Jerry Thomas to the lively nights at hidden speakeasies to the convivial atmosphere enjoyed by today’s enthusiasts, cocktails are a lifeforce that celebrate the human spirit, among other spirits, and they serve as a testament to both tradition and innovation. No one yet knows what the cocktails of the future will look like, but it’s a safe bet that the mixologists of tomorrow will have an excellent time shaking things up. 

Turf Club Twin Falls

Distilling opened up a new world of possibilities within cocktail culture. In medieval times, monks and the upper class started producing their own liquors in their homes, mainly for medicinal purposes. However, eventually, people began to experiment with pure distilled drinks. Oftentimes, they were too strong for enjoyment, so what was the answer? Dilute it with sugar, citrus fruits, and spices. And who came up with this? Across the Atlantic and Indian Oceans from England, India was ahead of the game in crafting “punch,” a mixture similar to modern-day cocktails. As the English colonized India in the 18th century, punch made its way to the Brits by sea, leaving a lasting mark on the history of cocktails. The Indian punch included 5 simple ingredients: alcohol, sugar, lemon, water, and spices. Often served in large bowls at social gatherings and upper-class events, mixed punch quickly gained traction in England and spread throughout the country. These concoctions laid the foundation for today's cocktail culture, emphasizing the art of balancing flavors and blending seemingly unrelated ingredients into a harmonious creation. 

History

Punch Origins
The beginning of human history-1850s
    Humans have likely been mixing alcohol with other ingredients since humans had discovered alcohol in our first civilizations. People have drank socially in nearly every major global culture in one way or another. In America, modern mixology has roots in the Europeans who colonized our shores. The Pilgrims aboard the Mayflower brought liquor with them to Plymouth. Right about the time that America was being colonized, it was very fashionable to drink punch in Europe, particularly among the British. There was a belief that drinking still water could be dangerous. This meant that punch could provide a “safe” alternative for hydration at gatherings. The word itself has roots in the word “paunch,” which means “five” in Hindu, having been popularized by British servicemen in India. The five ingredients of punch were traditionally spirit, lemon, sugar, water, and spice. Punch was useful to sailors because their beer would go flat in warm temperatures and the other ingredients (liquor, citrus, and spice) were easily accessible on large varieties of foreign soil. American drinking culture before the Golden Age was devoid of the cocktail. At a drinking establishment, a patron could most likely order liquor, wine, or beer. Punch was very much a social endeavor, something people organized for a party beforehand, and not something to be ordered at a tavern.
    The punchbowl is a proto-cocktail in a way. It contains the ingredients that essentially make up a cocktail, yet one isn’t comfortable calling it a cocktail exactly. It’s worth mentioning to set the stage for American cocktail culture and mixology. All of the ingredients had been there for a long while, they were just waiting to be enterprise into a cocktail as we know it today.
Drink: Punch
    Part of the fun in making punch is rotating those five “paunch” ingredients (liquor, citrus, sugar, water, and spice) in new fashions that you enjoy. Current college students may call this “jungle juice.” Indeed, they are mixologist making their own form of punch.
In a prep bowl:
Peel 2 Lemons
Add 0.5 cup of superfine sugar
Muddle and let sit for 4 hours to allow the sugar to extract oils from the peels
Stir in 4oz fresh lemon juice
Add 16oz of spirit (brandy used in the video)
Add 8oz of spirit (port used in the video)
Add 2 cups water
Stir together and strain into the punch bowl
Garnish on top with grated nutmeg
Add ice if you like. For the authentic 1800s feel, leave it out


Golden Age
1850s to 1919
    Cocktails were certainly being created before 1850. In 1827, Oxford students would publish the first known alcoholic beverage recipe book. However, it wasn’t yet a national facet of American society or something that one could order at a bar. The Golden Age of American cocktails was spurred by a few factors. First, there was a mass amount of immigration from Europe. Central European immigrants brought with them their love of communal drinking. Secondly, the Industrial Revolution was now in full swing. This ballooned the size of cities and made most every common good less expensive to produce, including spirits. Lastly, the US government relaxed their taxes on alcohols that they had long fancied as a way to pay for wars. Immigration, the Industrial Revolution, and lessened taxes spurred the Golden Age of mixology. The last ingredient, innovation, would come in part when Jerry Thomas would publish his famous book, the Bar-Tender’s Guide, in 1862. By then he was a bartender famous for having poured drinks from San Fransisco to New York City and had built a reputation as the best of the best. Bartenders were very secretive about their recipes and kept them as competitive secrets. Thomas broke that mold and penned the first modern bartender’s book, opening the profession to the masses and proliferating the trade of the bartender. By this point, bartenders were now stars. People flooded to have drinks made by specific bartenders due to their quality. Henry Craddock, an American-trained British bartender, was learning his craft.People referred to mixology, the art and science of making a better cocktail. Many modern American cocktails have roots in this era. The martini, highballs, flip drinks, and sidecars. These four cocktails, including the daiquiri (invented in Cuba) and the old fashioned (older than even this cocktail era) form the basis of modern cocktail variation. Cocktails as we know them were contemporized in this time period. The future was very bright for the cocktail world.
Recipe 1
Drink: Mint Julep
    The mint julep is one of the famous cocktails described by Jerry Thomas. Because it is so old, there are many different ways of making the drink. Please feel free to explore and tinker with the recipe to fit your own needs.
For the modern, iconic cocktail:

Use 8-10 leaves of mint and place them in the bottom of the julep glass
Add one sugar cube and 0.25oz simple syrup
Add 2oz bourbon
Muddle the mint and the sugar at the bottom of the glass briefly
Add crushed or pebbled ice, but not too much, and stir the drink
Fill to the top and cap with crushed or pebbled ice. Garnish with a mint sprig. A straw highly recommended

Prohibition
1919 to 1940s
    Until it wasn’t. American protestant fundamentalists, fueled by xenophobic attitudes and feeling like America was becoming “less American” due to European alcohol drinkers, moved to ban the production and consumption of alcohol in 1919. This caused a brain drain among America’s most talented mixologists. Many moved internationally to continue their craft or they changed profession altogether. America had built a reputation for crafting the finest cocktails and Europeans were eager to tap into this resource. Harry Craddock would return home to Britain due to Prohibition and bartend the American bar in the Savoy Hotel. While there, he would publish his Savoy Cocktail Book. This would help to further popularize cocktails globally. The name “American” bar is no coincidence. It is a mark of prestige for bartenders, having learned the craft around other prominent mixologists and where it had origins.
    In an ironic twist of fate, the xenophobic attitudes that helped make prohibition possible were a large part of its undoing. Criminal organizations led by Europeans would rise and supply the still very high demand for alcohol in America. The average American that could get their hands on liquor found it to be of lower quality and often just drank it at home. Speakeasies became popular, although their reality is far from the popular fantasy. Most speakeasies, certainly the kind that the average American could access, were essentially a basement with spare furnishings. The bar itself might have just been wood atop spare barrels. Notably, it was in these speakeasies that men and women would drink together and break the law. Flapper dresses emerged and the speakeasy influenced American ideas of sex and gender.
    Prohibition would become wildly unpopular in the late 1920s. Wealthy Americans would flaunt their power and drink in the open. Many circles feared that the American rule of law itself had been weakened because prohibition was so openly violated, leading to Americans feeling comfortable breaking other laws. Prohibition was eventually repealed in 1933, in part to help raise tax revenue due to the Great Depression. Due to bartenders leaving America in such great numbers and the Second World War, mixology could not effectively recover and remained in the shadows.

Recipe 2
Drink: French 75
    Representing the fun decadence and art deco culture of the roaring ‘20s, a cocktail like the French 75 would have only been available to the most wealthy of Americans. It is described by Harry Craddock in his Savoy Cocktail book. It was a favorite of American expatriates, including Great Gatsby author F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway. They supposedly drank it together at Harry’s American Bar in Paris.
    For an authentic prohibition experience more in line with what the average American would drink: find the cheapest vodka or whiskey you can find, whatever citrus or citrus you might have around your house, and then drink them together in your dark basement silently.
Note: it is disputed whether the French 75 originally used brandy or gin as its main spirit. Thankfully, it's delicious both ways. I personally prefer brandy, but gin was much more available to Americans during prohibition.
In a shaker, squeeze 0.5oz of lemon juice
Add 0.5oz simple syrup
Add 1oz gin (or brandy)
Shake with ice
Stain ice chips out and pour the drink into a champagne glass
Top with champagne
Garnish with a lemon twist
Postwar Tiki
1940 to 1970
    After World War II, American mixology met a crossroads. The American economy soared to new heights. The average American had a large amount of spending money and was parched. However, American mixology was still in a temporary Dark Age. Some small areas in America, however, revitalized old cocktail traditions. In the late 1930s, Donn Beach opened his Donn the Beachcomber Bar in Hollywood. It was decorated all over with relics of the Caribbean and island Pacific. He had previously sailed these areas and learned their cocktail cultures while younger (Donn was a showman, so take everything related to him with a grain of salt). During the Great Depression, this little corner of Hollywood provided a vacation of sorts. One could escape into another world. It was also the home to the best cocktails one could find. Before Prohibition, American bartenders escaped in numbers to the Caribbean. The cocktail culture there preserved American mixology and its good practices. The feel of the bar was unique and it attracted celebrities. One didn’t need to dress up and there wasn’t a band. Instead, it encapsulated adventure and mystique. Trader Vic opened a similar bar in Oakland having toured the Caribbean’s cocktail culture and visited Donn’s bar. By the time World War II was over, Vic expanded across the United States and Donn Beach was close behind. Americans loved the Tiki bar. Going there was a fun event where showmen like Vic and Donn provided good cocktails along with a desirable atmosphere. Exotica music became popular across the US as Tiki culture spread.
    This would not last, however, as the US entered the Jet Age and the late 1960s. By that time, if Americans wanted to go on a Caribbean or Pacific vacation they would simply do so. The atmosphere around tiki changed completely. Instead of being young and avant-garde, it quickly became seen as tacky and kitsch. Young Americans saw tiki as something that their parents liked while they reminisced about movie stars from the ‘30s and ‘40s. Tiki became “washed up” as young Americans explored new ideas in the Cold War. By the late 1970s, tiki had gone from a global enterprise to almost closing altogether. Donn the Beachcomber closed and Trader Vic’s barely survived into today. Unfortunately, as tiki went out the door, so did its preservation of good mixology.





Recipe 3
Drink: Mai Tai 
    This drink was invented by Trader Vic himself with inspiration from the good mixology of Caribbean beverages. Donn Beach contests that he actually invented the drink, although historical sources point towards Vic. This goes to show how important showmanship was for tiki. The Mai Tai was very popular and is emblematic of tiki itself: a unique concoction that "borrows" from foreign ideas to monetize a uniquely American experience.
In a shaker, 2 oz of rum (ideally three types white unaged, golden oak aged, dark or blackstrap)
Add 0.75oz curaçao (an orange liqueur from the Caribbean)
1oz lime juice
0.5oz orgeat (an almond syrup used in numerous tiki drinks)
Add ice and shake
Strain into glass
Fill with crushed or pebbled ice
Garnish with lime and mint

Dark Ages
1970 to 1990
    The Dark Ages of Mixology are a time that bartenders look back upon with mixed feelings. Really, the dark ages can be extended backward to the 1940s if one is willing to exclude tiki and other proper cocktail establishments. While aspects of pre-prohibition mixology remained in certain bright spots during the dark ages, by and large, American mixology was lost and making sub-par drinks. The average American during the dark ages might order a cocktail at a party or nightclub, which played a heavy influence on the mixology of this period. Special shot drinks and different words ending in -tini became popular. It would be during this time that James Bond would ask for his vodka martini “shaken, not stirred.” Shaking this recipe produces something that provides nothing to the flavor palate and nothing to bartending as a whole, but it does get you drunk fast and make you look cool while doing it. By and large, alcohol was a tool used by people to enjoy other things, not the cocktail itself. Bartenders in this era rarely used fresh ingredients and instead used mass-produced mixes to sweeten drinks and speed up their construction. Like many aspects of Western society in this time, cocktails in this era were not an art but mass-produced and heavily monetized.
    This does not mean this era was without its artists. Dale DeGroff and other prominent bartenders started to explore the old works of Jerry Thomas and research the Golden Age during the late ‘80s. While not massive in popularity, this would help set the stage for the bars of the future.
Modern Revival
1990 to present
    Bartending has come a long way since even the 2000s into today. To describe modern cocktail mixology, I’ll do it through the lens of the materials that I used to learn bartending. The Death & Co Cocktail book, the Cocktail Codex book, and Liquid Intelligence. All three of these books act as a piece of the puzzle that brings mixology to its current state. The Death & Co cocktail book shows the evolution that the New York bar went through to take part in popularizing golden age mixology. It separated itself from the party atmosphere of the dark ages and went back to the bar roots of the early 1900s. Research was done to revitalize the craft of mixology. This research is shown in their other book, Cocktail Codex. This details their theory that all cocktails stem from variations of the old-fashioned, the martini, the daiquiri, the sidecar, the whiskey highball, and the flip (see image at the very bottom). This expanded their understanding of all cocktails in context with one another and helped them to create new cocktails and craft old ones. The book Liquid Intelligence brought scientific study into the picture to examine the cocktail on the chemical level. This helped bartenders to craft the best possible cocktail.
    Mixology today is entering its own new golden age. The cocktails of the 1800s are being faithfully recreated and the thought process behind their balance is being explored to create new cocktails. The average American can find a cocktail bar and enjoy these progressions in mixology.

Recipe 4
Drink: Oxaca Old Fashioned
The famous and popular drink from the Death & Co bar. It combines the ancient recipe of the old-fashioned with the modern cocktail craft process. It uses both tequila and mezcal. In the past, tequila was a poor quality spirit that was inexpensive and used for shots. Today, the process of making tequila has many overlaps with the way the French make wine. The result is that today, tequila is entering its modern renaissance in terms of liquor quality. While tequila still is trying to shake its stigma, drinks like the Oaxaca old-fashioned one shake up the norms of mixology and present something as unique as it is enjoyable.
Note: mezcal is a spirit made of agave outside of Tequila, Mexico. This is a similar relationship that sparkling wine has with Champagne. Mezcal has a more “spice” profile compared to tequila, similar to the relationship between rye and bourbon.

In an old fashioned glass, add 1.5oz reposado tequila
Add 0.5oz mezcal
Add 1 bar spoon of agave syrup
Add 2 dashes of angostura bitters
Add one big ice cube and stir in the glass
Garnish with an expressed orange peel

Historiography
“Bartenders were important men in their milieu, but that milieu—which we shall discuss—compiled its historical record by anecdote and barroom reminiscence, not systematic investigation backed by documents”
-David Wondrich, in Imbibe!
    The historiography surrounding bartending and mixology is perfectly encapsulated by this quote. Bartenders are very scientific about their beverages and not about where they come from. Other than cocktail menus, it is impossible to examine who created what first. Details surrounding bartenders and mixology are often an imperfect oral history. The recipes of two cocktails with the same name may be different. Many of these menus have been lost to time. While mixology can certainly have an effect on society, for the most part, it is something that exemplifies what is going on in larger society.
    Almost every book or source surrounding bartending and mixology is itself a cocktail recipe book first and foremost. The history in these books exists for the purpose of aiding the craft of cocktails; it not a precise historical study of mixology. Creating this website was difficult because I could not approach it like anything I have ever done in the past. There was lots of sifting through information to determine what was useful and what was reasonably credible. Useful primary sources were the most difficult to find. Bars have a taboo around them, which means they often exist in the shadows. Bartenders kept their recipes secret for a long time and many do today. Old recipe books are few and far between. Prohibition served as a massive barrier of information and tradition; this time period is also hard to research because people were breaking laws.
    Mixology specifically is uncharted territory historically. There is plenty of study conducted about society during these times and even their general drinking habits. Prohibition garners a large amount of attention in this regard. However, what was happening to the cocktails themselves is harder to pin down. I hope that this website provides information and spurs more research.
    In many ways, the practice of bartending is a historical one. Every cocktail is a mix of something old with something new. I'm excited for the future as we learn more about the past.
