COCKTAIL SPEC: Smoke & Honey

Type: Sour (egg white)

Ingredients:
- 1.5 oz Reposado Tequila
- 0.5 oz Amaro Nonino
- 0.75 oz Smoked Honey Syrup
- 0.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
- 1 Egg White

Method:
- Dry shake all ingredients without ice
- Add ice and shake again until well chilled
- Double strain into a chilled coupe
- Garnish: Smoked salt rim and a dehydrated lemon wheel

Notes:
- Ideal for early fall or late summer menus
- Balances savory, sweet, and bitter for guest intrigue
- Smoke note adds seasonal storytelling value without requiring in-service smoke prep
- Pairs well with pork belly, charred corn, and mushroom-forward plates

Operational Considerations:

- Egg white inclusion aligns with house policy for sours
- Smoked salt rim should be applied pre-service to streamline execution
