Tags: gin, collins, lavender, batching, profit audit, summer, highball, floral, house cocktails

Base Spirit: Gin  
Build:
- 1.5 oz House Gin  
- 0.75 oz Lavender Syrup  
- 0.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice  
- Top with Soda Water

Method:
1. Shake the gin, syrup, and lemon juice with ice.  
2. Strain into a Collins glass filled with fresh ice.  
3. Top with soda water and stir gently to incorporate.

Garnish:
- Dehydrated lemon wheel (recommended for shelf life and visual appeal)

Notes:
This floral highball is a summer-friendly crowd pleaser. Swapping in house gin reduces costs without sacrificing flavor due to the dominant lavender and citrus notes. Lavender syrup can be batched in small quantities to control waste.
