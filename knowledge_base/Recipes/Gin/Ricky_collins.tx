COCKTAIL SPEC: Ricky Collins

Type: Shaken + Topped, Tom Collins Variation

Ingredients:
- 1.5 oz Citrus-Forward Gin
- 0.5 oz Limoncello
- 0.75 oz Cranberry Shrub
- 0.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice

Method:
- Add all ingredients to a shaker with ice (except club soda)
- Shake until well chilled
- Strain into a chilled Collins glass over fresh ice
- Top with club soda (approx. 2–3 oz, to taste)
- Garnish: Lemon wheel, 1–2 cranberries, and light dusting of confectioners’ sugar

Notes:
- Bright, tart, and lightly sweet — ideal as a seasonal Collins riff
- Cranberry shrub provides acid complexity and vibrant color
- Limoncello adds soft citrus sweetness to complement the gin backbone

Operational Considerations:
- Use a citrus-forward gin (e.g., Tanqueray 10, Bombay Citron Pressé, malfi limon or arranciata) to maintain balance with the shrub
- Cranberry shrub can be house-made: equal parts cranberry juice, sugar, and red wine vinegar, infused with orange peel
- Garnish prep: Dust cranberries and lemon wheel in powdered sugar pre-service; store chilled and dry
- Can be pre-batched (minus lemon and soda) for service speed
