COCKTAIL SPEC: Polaris (Modern Tropical Gin)

Type: Shaken + Double Strained

Ingredients:
- 1.5 oz London Dry or Modern Botanical Gin (e.g. Fordâ€™s, Monkey 47, St. George Botanivore)
- 0.5 oz Velvet Falernum
- 0.75 oz Pineapple Juice (fresh pressed or cold-pressed)
- 0.5 oz Lime Juice
- 0.5 oz Honey Syrup (3:2 ratio)
- 1 dash Absinthe (optional rinse or barspoon into tin)
- 2 drops saline solution (optional)

Method:
- Shake all ingredients with ice until well chilled
- Double strain into a chilled Nick & Nora or coupe
- Garnish: Expressed grapefruit peel or dehydrated pineapple crisp

Notes:
- A brighter, cleaner approach to tropical flavors with gin's botanicals front and center
- Falernum + pineapple provide warmth and body; honey softens acidity while adding mouthfeel
- Absinthe and saline bring complexity and structure to the finish

Operational Considerations:
- Use clarified pineapple if available to improve texture and foam clarity
- Honey syrup: 3 parts honey to 2 parts hot water by mass, whisked until integrated
- Can batch all ingredients except lime and absinthe for speed rail deployment
