COCKTAIL SPEC: House Martini

Type: Stirred, Spirit-Forward

Ingredients:
- 2.5 oz Plymouth Gin
- 0.75 oz Dolin Dry Vermouth
- 2 dashes Orange Bitters

Method:
- Add all ingredients to a mixing glass with ice
- Stir for 15–20 turns until properly chilled and diluted
- Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass
- Garnish: Expressed orange twist (preferred) or olives (guest preference)

Notes:
- Uses a 3.3:1 gin-to-vermouth ratio for balanced dryness and complexity
- Orange bitters round out the citrus and botanical notes, enhancing the interplay between gin and vermouth
- Plymouth provides a soft, classic profile ideal for both citrus and briny garnishes

Operational Considerations:
- Should be stirred à la minute for proper dilution and chill
- Glassware must be pre-chilled for optimal guest presentation
- Batchable for high-volume prep (gin + vermouth + bitters); stir fresh for dilution and service polish
