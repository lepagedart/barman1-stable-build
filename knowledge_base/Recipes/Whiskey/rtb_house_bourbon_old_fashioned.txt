COCKTAIL SPEC: House Old Fashioned

Type: Stirred, Spirit-Forward

Ingredients:
- 2.5 oz Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon
- 0.75 oz Demerara Syrup (2:1 by mass)
- 2 dashes Regans’ Orange Bitters
- 2 dashes Angostura Aromatic Bitters

Method:
- Add all ingredients to a mixing glass with ice
- Stir until well chilled and properly diluted
- Strain over a large clear ice cube in a double Old Fashioned glass
- Garnish: Expressed orange peel (discarded or clipped)

Notes:
- This build emphasizes Elijah Craig’s vanilla and spice notes while rounding with rich demerara sweetness
- Balanced bitterness from both orange and aromatic bitters creates layered depth without overshadowing the base spirit
- Higher bourbon spec (2.5 oz) increases perceived value and mouthfeel

Operational Considerations:
- Suitable for batching (bourbon + syrup + bitters); stir to order for dilution control
- Demerara syrup standard: 2:1 by mass for body and shelf life
- Large-format clear ice enhances visual appeal and slows dilution for a refined sip experience
