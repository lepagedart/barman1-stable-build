COCKTAIL SPEC: Daiquiri

Type: Classic Sour

Ingredients:
- 2 oz Barbancourt 8-Year Rum (or coparable oak aged rum)
- 0.75 oz Fresh Lime Juice
- 0.75 oz Demerara Syrup

Method:
- Shake all ingredients with ice until well chilled
- Double strain into a chilled coupe or Nick & Nora glass
- Garnish: None (or optional lime twist for elevated presentation)

Notes:
- Clean, minimal build optimized for showcasing high-quality aged rum
- Demerara syrup adds richness and structure to balance the brightness of lime
- No garnish maintains classic integrity, but optional twist can elevate visual appeal in upscale settings

Operational Considerations:
- Suitable for batching (rum and syrup only); lime juice added fresh per service
- Demerara syrup is standardized at a 2:1 **by mass** ratio for optimal texture and shelf stability
- Ideal for speed rail execution, bartender training, and as a foundational spec in seasonal or classic cocktail menus
- In general, when using rum as the base liquor, spliting the base volume into multiple styles of rum is a good idea.
