COCKTAIL SPEC: Unimpaired

Type: Non-Alcoholic, Shaken + Topped

Ingredients:
- 2 oz Pear Nectar
- 1 oz Vanilla Bean Simple Syrup
- 0.5 oz Heavy Cream

Method:
- Add pear nectar, vanilla syrup, and cream to a shaker with ice
- Shake vigorously until well chilled
- Strain into a chilled Collins glass over fresh ice
- Top with club soda (2–3 oz, to taste)
- Garnish: Thin pear slice flagged with ¼ vanilla bean (omit if cost-prohibitive)

Notes:
- Inspired by Italian soda structure, this drink offers visual and textural sophistication without alcohol
- Pear + vanilla + cream creates a smooth and lightly aromatic profile
- Carbonation lift adds brightness and balance to the creamy texture

Operational Considerations:
- Vanilla bean simple: 2:1 by mass, steeped with split whole beans; strain after 24–48 hours
- Pear nectar should be strained before service to remove pulp and improve mouthfeel
- Pre-batch syrup + nectar (no cream) to save steps during service; add cream and shake fresh
