that adherence to traditional recipes, as suggested, may
limit culinary exploration and expression (Bassett,
2016). Thus, while the author's viewpoint on martini

Chapter 1 | THE OLD-FASHIONED| Q&A
1.Question
What are the fundamental components of an
Old-Fashioned cocktail?
Answer:The fundamental components of an
Old-Fashioned cocktail include a spirit (commonly
bourbon), sugar, bitters, and water (in the form of
ice).
2.Question
How does the choice of bourbon affect the flavor of an
Old-Fashioned?
Answer:The choice of bourbon can significantly affect the
flavor of an Old-Fashioned. A sweeter bourbon, made with a
higher corn percentage, brings a different profile compared to
a spicier bourbon with more rye. Selecting a bourbon that
balances sweetness and spiciness, such as Elijah Craig Small
Batch, enhances the complexity of the drink without
overwhelming it.
3.Question
What is the benefit of using Demerara Gum Syrup over
regular simple syrup in an Old-Fashioned?
Answer:Demerara Gum Syrup is denser than regular simple
syrup, which allows it to add richness and body to the
cocktail without diluting it as much. This enhances the
whiskey's flavor profile while maintaining a well-balanced
Old-Fashioned.
4.Question
Why is the precise measurement of sugar important in an
Old-Fashioned?

Chapter 4 | THE SIDECAR| Q&A
1.Question
What is the origin story of the Sidecar cocktail?
Answer:The Sidecar is rumored to have been
created by an American army captain during World

drink.
4.Question
Why is sparkling water considered a crucial component
of the Highball?
Answer:Sparkling water is a crucial component of the
Highball as it acts as the primary mixer that balances the
drink. Its effervescence dilutes the intensity of the whisky,
makes it more refreshing, and enhances the aromatic
experience as the bubbles carry aromas to the drinker’s nose.
The quality of the sparkling water, including its carbonation
level and mineral content, can significantly influence the
flavor interaction with whisky.

experimenting with different core spirits and mixers. For
instance, gin can replace whisky, while tonic or juice can
substitute sparkling water. Additionally, variations can
include splits in the core spirit (like using both Campari and
vermouth in an Americano) or adjusting the proportions of
mixer to spirit. Other mixers, like flavored sodas or sparkling
wines, can also create novel Highball experiences, allowing
for creativity while maintaining a refreshing profile.
6.Question
What do the Japanese approaches to Highball
preparation highlight about the drink?
Answer:Japanese approaches to Highball preparation
emphasize precision, ritual, and the importance of each
component in the drink. Techniques like specific stirring
counts and using optimal water highlight the respect for the
ingredients and the artistry in cocktail making. This culture

of creating unique Highballs allows bartenders to showcase
this duality, making each drink a blend of discipline and
creativity.
8.Question
What should be considered when selecting mixers to
enhance the Highball experience?
Answer:When selecting mixers for the Highball, one should
consider flavor compatibility, texture, and the overall balance
of the cocktail. The mixer should enhance and complement
the core spirit without overwhelming it. It’s also important to
consider the characteristics of the mixer, like sweetness or
bitterness, which can influence the overall taste, acidity
perception, and mouthfeel of the drink. Freshness and quality
of the mixer, especially if it's juice or soda, are also key for a
more vibrant cocktail.
