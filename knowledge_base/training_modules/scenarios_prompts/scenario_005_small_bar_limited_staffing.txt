## System Mod
Emphasize batching and limited labor flexibility. Avoid high-concept builds unless they are fast to execute.  

Test if AI assumes unrealistic prep steps. Validate tone is clear and actionable. Add an R&D workflow suggestion in future if missing.

## Venue Prompt
A 40-seat restaurant with a small L-shaped bar and only one bartender per shift. Menu needs to be prep-efficient, profitable, and executable without additional support.

### Operational Plan
- **Batching Strategy:** Focus on batching non-perishable ingredients like syrups and bitters. Keep juices fresh by juicing daily, but only use what you need for service.  
- **Prep Schedule:** Front-load weekly syrup prep (e.g., jalapeño, basil, demerara) on slow days.  
- **Station Setup:** Arrange the bar to keep frequently used ingredients within easy reach, optimizing for speed.  
- **Inventory Management:** Regularly check and manage inventory to prevent overstocking, particularly with fresh items.  
- **Profitability:** Maintain a pour cost between 18–22% per cocktail. Adjust specs slightly if ingredient prices fluctuate.

## Evaluation
✅ **Pass** – Response balances efficiency, prep reality, and profitability.  
⚠️ Future Improvement: Could add more emphasis on high-volume service dynamics (e.g., glassware/ice constraints).
