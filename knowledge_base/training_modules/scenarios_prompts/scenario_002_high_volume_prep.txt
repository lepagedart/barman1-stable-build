Scenario 002: High-Volume Prep

Description
A busy venue with a large bar and fast-paced service wants to improve bar efficiency without sacrificing quality. The focus is on batching, layout, and ticket flow.

System Prompt Mod

Emphasize speed and execution feasibility under high-volume conditions. Avoid service-slowing ideas like rare garnishes, multiple shake techniques, or staff-intensive builds. Prioritize batching, layout, and workflow improvements that maintain quality without slowing ticket flow.

Venue Prompt

A busy venue with a large bar and fast-paced service wants to improve bar efficiency without sacrificing cocktail quality. Staff size is sufficient for batching and support roles. Focus: speed, prep efficiency, and throughput.

User Prompt

Design an operational plan and cocktail framework for a high-volume venue. Highlight batching strategies, layout/cheater bottle usage, and staff workflow improvements that maintain drink quality while cutting ticket times.

Rubric Evaluation

Strengths
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Correctly prioritized batching and pre-dilution ‚Üí matches ‚Äúefficiency under load‚Äù intent.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Operational plan is well-structured (menu, batching, layout, workflow, service speed).
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Cocktail examples lean on classics (Manhattan, Margarita) ‚Üí appropriate for batching.
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Explicit staff workflow roles included ‚Üí reflects consulting-style guidance.

Weaknesses
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Cocktail builds lack cost notes (no pour cost targets).
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Garnish prep good, but missing efficiency checks (e.g., shelf-life validation for juices).
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Drinks could risk over-simplification ‚Üí system mod note about not diluting menu into ‚Äúhouse only‚Äù needs reinforcement.
	‚Ä¢	‚ö†Ô∏è Missing ‚Äúflag‚Äù mechanism: AI should caution when layout advice may not apply to small teams.

Score: Pass with Revisions
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Scenario goal (speed/efficiency) achieved.
	‚Ä¢	üîÑ Needs refinement on cost-awareness, scaling cautions, and slightly deeper build examples.

Corrected / Improved Write-up (KB Ready)

Operational Plan (Refined)
	‚Ä¢	Menu Design: Limit to 6‚Äì8 cocktails. Ensure balance of spirit families. Keep specs approachable for green staff.
	‚Ä¢	Batching: Batch with measured dilution when shelf-life allows. Liquor-only batching = safe for multiple days. Juice-inclusive batching = daily rotation.
	‚Ä¢	Layout: Duplicate speed rail setups per station. Prioritize high-use batched cocktails in cheater bottles.
	‚Ä¢	Staff Workflow: Assign roles (bartender = service, barback = batching/restock). Reinforce standardized station setup for interchangeability.
	‚Ä¢	Service Speed: Build should never exceed two steps. Training should include time trials and stress testing.

Cocktail Framework (Refined)
	1.	Batch Manhattan
	‚Ä¢	Rye, vermouth, bitters, water (pre-diluted)
	‚Ä¢	Rocks glass / large ice / cherry
	‚Ä¢	Cost target ‚â§20%
	2.	Pre-Diluted Margarita
	‚Ä¢	Tequila, triple sec, lime, simple, water (pre-diluted)
	‚Ä¢	Rocks / salted rim / lime wheel
	‚Ä¢	Cost target ‚â§22%
	3.	Gin & Tonic (Batchable Variant)
	‚Ä¢	Gin, tonic syrup, water (pre-diluted)
	‚Ä¢	Highball / cubes / lime wedge
	‚Ä¢	Cost target ‚â§20%

Operational Note: Add a seasonal high-volume friendly special (e.g., batched Paloma or spritz). Keep rotating slot for guest engagement without slowing throughput.
