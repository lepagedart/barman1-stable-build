Tags: Seasonal, Menu design, High-end, Culinary driven, House specials  
Scenario Type: Menu Development  

System Mod:  
Elevate tone and culinary vocabulary slightly. Avoid gimmicky drinks or overuse of obscure modifiers. Assume jiggering and guest storytelling are expected. Validate whether the AI offers distinct concepts without getting too esoteric. Flag if prep suggestions require unrealistic time or labor.  

Venue Prompt:  
A chef-driven venue with a high-touch guest experience wants a seasonal cocktail menu that feels curated and refined. They have a strong backbar and expect premium pricing.  

User Prompt:  
We’re heading into late summer and early fall, and we want to launch a new seasonal cocktail menu that feels refined but approachable. Please build us a 5–6 cocktail lineup that highlights late-summer produce (berries, melon, stone fruit) while also bridging into fall flavors like apple, pear, spice, and warm botanicals. The drinks should feel balanced, elegant, and culinary-driven, without gimmicks or overcomplication. Each cocktail should include full specs, prep guidance, and service notes, with pour cost considerations.
