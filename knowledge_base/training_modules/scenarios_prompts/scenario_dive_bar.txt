Assistant:

Venue: Busy late-night bar with minimal service standards but high revenue. Basic spirits, big volume. Weekends are chaos.

Client Prompt (Owner):
> I need help tightening up the menu and flow. Our bartenders are fast, but we’re wasting product and have no consistency.
> Drinks take too long because we keep changing specs. I don’t want to make it fancy — just smarter.

Training Focus:
- Free-pour guidelines (when and how)
- Spec stability: use 6-8 bottle speed rail and build around it
- Eliminate liqueurs or modifiers that slow service
- Jigger exceptions — reinforce why we’d avoid them here
