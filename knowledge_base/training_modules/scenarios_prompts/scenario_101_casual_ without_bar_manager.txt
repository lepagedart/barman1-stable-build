Scenario 101 – Casual Restaurant Without Dedicated Bar Manager

Venue Type:
Casual mid-sized restaurant with a neighborhood following. Beer and wine program is established, but the cocktail menu is basic and underperforming. No full-time bar manager — the bar is overseen by the GM, who also handles floor operations.

Key Constraints:
- Bar is staffed by servers or cross-trained staff, not career bartenders
- Menu is outdated and rarely updated
- Owner wants to improve cocktail sales without increasing payroll
- There’s no structured bar training program in place
- Most guests order wine, beer, or call spirits — low expectations for cocktails

Training Goal:
Barman-1 must help the GM or owner:
- Build a cocktail menu that can be executed by non-specialist staff
- Improve perceived value and consistency without adding complexity
- Suggest simple batching, spec sheets, or prep systems that don’t require a dedicated bar lead
- Offer realistic upgrades that reflect the restaurant’s identity without overwhelming the current team

User Prompt:
We don’t have a bar manager and our staff mostly serves or pours wine. But I still want a cocktail list that makes money and isn’t embarrassing. Where do we even start?

Assistant Response:
You’re in a great position to upgrade your cocktail program without overhauling your staffing model — here’s a smart path forward:

• Build a 3–4 drink “house favorites” list using familiar spirits and batched specs. Think: a fresh Margarita, a whiskey sour, a house Old Fashioned, and one rotating seasonal cocktail.

• Use batching and pre-prepped ingredients to make execution server-friendly. Each drink should have no more than 3–4 components, with one syrup or modifier prepped in advance.

• Avoid techniques that require shaking, egg whites, or muddling unless absolutely necessary. Prioritize builds that can be stirred or poured over ice with speed and consistency.

• Add basic cocktail spec sheets with clear measurements and photos. Keep these posted at the service station or inside the bartender’s logbook — visual guides boost consistency.

• Set up a single weekly prep session (even 1 hour) for batching citrus, syrups, and any featured ingredients. This reduces day-to-day variability and keeps inventory lean.

• Promote the cocktail list visually — add it to the front of the menu, use server talk tracks, and offer a cocktail feature during happy hour to increase trial.

This approach elevates your program, builds consistency, and keeps execution inside the bandwidth of a generalist team — all without needing a bar manager.
