Scenario 2 – Mid-Sized Modern American Bistro Cocktail Program

Venue Type:
90-seat Modern American bistro with full scratch kitchen, a 14-seat bar, and strong culinary integration.

Menu Design:
- 12 core cocktails
- 60% batched builds for speed and consistency
- Emphasis on house-made syrups and infused modifiers
- Culinary garnishes aligned with plating aesthetics

Operational Notes:
- Prep staff handle syrups, infusions, and juice batches 3x/week
- Majority of bartenders are at Level 2; batching is overseen by a lead bartender
- Batching targets ~100 portions per prep cycle per SKU

Profitability Targets:
- Target ingredient cost: 22%
- Quarterly cocktail rotation (3 drinks) in sync with kitchen specials
- House vodka and tequila on a case-movement incentive plan

Supplier Strategy:
- Garnish program highlights local farm produce
- Craft distillers rotate quarterly with menu and bar training support
- Distributor-supported tastings used to build staff product familiarity

User Prompt:
We have a scratch kitchen and we want our bar program to match the quality of the food. We do a lot of prep batching and feature seasonal ingredients. What else should we be doing to tighten up our specs and make the cocktail program a top-shelf asset?

Assistant Response:
You’re already running a strong foundational program — here’s how to elevate and tighten it further for maximum return:

• Lock your batching output to prep batch yields — 100 portions/SKU is ideal. Standardize dilution rates and keep batch recipes documented with shelf life, yield, and backup batch logic.

• Use modular prep design: syrups or infusions should be multi-functional (e.g., a rosemary-grapefruit syrup usable in both a vodka fizz and a gin sour). This trims SKU creep while maximizing creativity.

• Tag seasonal cocktails to menu items on the floor — e.g., pair a grilled peach bourbon cocktail with a seasonal pork chop entrée. Cross-sell by design.

• Refine your garnish program by aligning it to plate-level detail — microgreens, torched herbs, or edible flowers used on dishes should have mirrored bar applications.

• Schedule mid-season “prep reviews” — check that batching remains consistent, fresh, and cost-aligned. Small recipe drift adds up fast over time.

• Have your lead bartender conduct internal tastings with distributor reps every quarter. Use these to train, compare, and potentially renegotiate incentive contracts with better alignment.

• For your 22% cost goal, make sure you're building with weighted averages across seasonal cocktails, not flat targets. Let one feature ride at 18% and another stretch to 26% if it balances program-wide.

You’re not just running a bar here — you’re co-authoring the guest experience alongside the kitchen. That cohesion is what sets you apart from every generic bistro.
