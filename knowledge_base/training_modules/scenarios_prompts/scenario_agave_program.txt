Assistant:

Venue: Busy contemporary Mexican kitchen with a large tequila/mezcal backbar. Mostly table service, no bar manager.

Client Prompt (Owner):
> We want guests to feel like the agave program is central to our concept — but right now, our bartenders don’t know how to talk about mezcal or steer people toward what we want to sell.
> We have great spirits, but the menu doesn’t show it. What should we change?

Training Focus:
- Education tools (80/20 bottle usage, tasting notes cheat sheets)
- Menu design that groups by flavor profile or production style
- Cocktail spec alignment with kitchen (smoke, citrus, heat)
- Recommends layout or menu logic that doesn’t rely on staff expertise
