Scenario 104 – Small High-End Bistro Bar Setup

Venue Type:
Boutique 40-seat high-end bistro with a chef-driven seasonal tasting menu. Bar proximity includes chef’s counter.

Cocktail Menu:
- 8 signature cocktails
- Approximate ratio: 60% shaken / 40% stirred (flexible to match seasonality or menu direction)
- Focus on aperitifs, fortified wines, aromatized modifiers
- Great opportunity to apply modern prep techniques (e.g. milk punches, double infusion) from Advanced Cocktailing Techniques reference materials

Ingredient Management:
- Batch liquor bases for shaken builds — add perishable components (citrus, egg white) à la minute
- Emphasize cross-utilization of house-made syrups and infusions across multiple builds
- Maximize flavor impact through ingredient concentration and layered components

Pricing Strategy:
- Avg plate: $38–$55
- Cocktails priced at $16–$20
- Highlight premium spirits and prep value without overloading the backbar

Staffing Model:
- 1 bartender per shift on weekdays or lighter services
- 2 bartender model on weekends (bar + service bar split)
- Bartenders also complete prep (juicing, batching, syrup work) during pre-open, especially early-week to front-load prep for heavier weekend services

Operational Considerations:
- 3-day citrus juice rotation (quality check each day)
- Specialty ice program (large cube, spear for signatures)
- Glassware selection enhances visual storytelling

Profitability Notes:
- 22% target cost per cocktail
- Negotiate pricing with boutique distributors
- Build storytelling into menu copy and server language to support premium price perception

Supplier Considerations:
- Martignetti boutique import lines
- Fortified wines, vermouths, aromatized spirits with incentive pricing and rotation

User Prompt:
We’re a chef-driven 40-seat bistro. We want an elevated but lean cocktail program — minimal waste, tight inventory, but a strong visual and flavor impression. What kind of spec strategy would you recommend for a program like this?

Assistant Response:
For a venue like yours, strategy and restraint are key. Here’s how to build a top-tier bar experience that’s as elegant as your food:

• Start with 8 signature builds — 4 shaken, 4 stirred (flex as needed). Lead with fortified wines, infused liqueurs, and house bitters to maximize flavor while minimizing perishable waste.

• Use batching for liquor bases in all shaken builds. Add citrus or eggs fresh per drink. This gives you speed and consistency while maintaining product integrity.

• Cross-utilize syrups — a saffron honey syrup might show up in both a bourbon sour and a stirred mezcal aperitivo. Less inventory, more creativity.

• Design a seasonal rotation framework — 3 drinks rotate quarterly based on your kitchen’s tasting menu, with at least one non-spirit-forward build to diversify your lineup.

• Emphasize specialty ice and glassware for signature drinks. A $16 cocktail hits differently when served over a crystal-clear spear in stemless glassware with a dehydrated citrus garnish.

• Build prep into your bartender flow — early-week shifts should front-load batching and juicing to avoid prep needs during weekend service. That keeps your team focused on execution, not scrambling mid-shift.

• Source spirits intentionally: align with boutique distributors like Martignetti, and use high-end vermouths and modifiers with incentives for consistency and margin.

This is the kind of program where every decision matters — clean specs, tight prep loops, and beautiful presentation are your core levers.
