Assistant:

Venue: A coffee shop that becomes a bar after 4pm using the same counter and staff. No dedicated bar setup or ice machine.

Client Prompt (Owner):
> We’re running evening cocktail service out of our café. The transition is bumpy and we’re not profitable yet.
> I need a drink menu that makes sense for this space and workflow. What should I change?

Training Focus:
- Cross-functional ingredient use (e.g., citrus, syrups, tea bases)
- No-shake specs or pitcher batching
- Menu organization and drinkware reuse
- Pre-batched cocktails built to live in the café fridge
