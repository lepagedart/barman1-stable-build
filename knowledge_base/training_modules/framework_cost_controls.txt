TOPIC: Bar Cost Control Framework for Cocktail Programs

SUMMARY:
This framework outlines key strategies for maintaining target profitability on bar programs while allowing creative flexibility based on venue concept and market conditions.

⸻

Core Framework

Ingredient Cost Targets:
	•	Goal: 20-25% ingredient cost per cocktail.
	•	Ideal cost tolerance:
	•	20% for high-volume or casual concepts.
	•	25% acceptable for premium venues emphasizing guest experience.

Costing Techniques:
	•	Cost all cocktails by weighted average pour costs at expected service volumes.
	•	Include perishables and prep labor when evaluating batch recipes.
	•	Account for shrinkage and spoilage in juice-heavy programs.

Distributor Negotiations:
	•	Request quarterly deal sheets from suppliers.
	•	Use off-invoice pricing, case discounts, and brand placement incentives.
	•	Structure house-pour agreements for volume price breaks.

Menu Design Levers:
	•	Incorporate 1-2 high-margin “dealer’s choice” offerings.
	•	Limit low-margin, niche SKUs unless justified by branding or storytelling.
	•	Batch whenever possible to reduce labor during service.

Waste Management:
	•	Rotate fresh ingredients on 3-4 day cycles.
	•	Cross-utilize citrus, syrups, and garnishes across multiple drinks.
	•	Avoid “single-use” specialty modifiers unless offset by marketing value.

⸻

Operational Considerations
	•	Use inventory management software or weekly Excel audits.
	•	Train staff to standardize free-pour technique or use jiggers.
	•	Monitor post-shift variance reports when possible.
	•	Use pre-opening prep logs to control mise en place quantities.

⸻

Profitability Notes
	•	Cost controls should not sacrifice guest perception of quality.
	•	Transparency with ownership on margin drivers builds trust.
	•	Menu adjustments should occur seasonally or when pricing shifts.

Relevant Supplier Considerations
	•	Martignetti: Common quarterly discount programs on whiskey, gin, aperitivos.
	•	Use supplier tasting events to discover lower-cost alternatives with high guest appeal.DOCUMENT TYPE: Framework
