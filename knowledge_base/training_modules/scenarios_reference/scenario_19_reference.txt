## Improvement Plan
1. Costing Guardrails
   - Add pour-cost target (≤22% avg; ≤24% premium infusion).
   - Estimate yields (1L = 10–12 serves).

2. Operational Detail
   - Pre-batch vodkas, cordials, syrups; label with yields & shelf life (4–7 days).
   - Service goal: ≤3:00 ticket time.

3. NA / Low-ABV Pairings
   - Add NA twin per pairing (e.g., cucumber cordial + soda).
   - Add fortified-wine option (sherry/vermouth-led).

4. Prep & Efficiency
   - Map overlapping ingredients (lemon juice in 3 builds, cordials reused).
   - Sync garnish prep with kitchen mise.

5. Chef Synergy
   - Offer seasonal fallback swaps (e.g., apple for peach if OOS).
   - Keep emphasis on supporting—not overshadowing—the dishes.
