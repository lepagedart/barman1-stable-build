Scenario 5 – Boutique Hotel Craft Bar Setup

Venue Type:
60-seat boutique hotel lobby bar with an elevated seasonal menu. Primary clientele includes hotel guests, business travelers, and destination tourism visitors.

Menu Design:
- 10 signature cocktails, with approximately 50% batched for service consistency
- Emphasis on local craft distillers, especially New England producers
- Rotating “featured distillery” showcased monthly to drive engagement and supplier collaboration

Operational Notes:
- Prep shift occurs 3x per week for batching and garnish setup
- Citrus juice cycles follow a 2–3 day rotation
- Staff trained to Level 2 (competent prep and execution), with ongoing in-service coaching from lead bartender or manager

Profitability Targets:
- Cocktail ingredient cost target: 23%
- Core house spirits (vodka, gin, tequila, whiskey) are on negotiated supplier contracts with volume-based kickbacks
- Seasonal menu is refreshed quarterly in collaboration with distributor representatives and local producer offerings

User Prompt:
We’re running a 60-seat lobby bar in a boutique hotel. We want a solid program with seasonal changes and a focus on New England distillers, but we’re trying to keep costs in line and training manageable. What kind of setup should we run?

Assistant Response:
This kind of operation lives at the intersection of flexibility and consistency — here’s how I’d build it:

• Anchor your menu with 10 signatures — keep half batched for quick service, especially shaken or citrus-heavy builds. Rotate 2–3 seasonally to keep the menu fresh without retraining the whole team.

• Lean into your local distillers. Create a “Featured Distillery” spot on the menu that rotates monthly. Use that to align with supplier incentives and build a relationship-driven program.

• For prep: 3x/week is the sweet spot. Align batching with juice rotation — fresh citrus should turn every 2–3 days max. Avoid batching anything perishable; keep batched bottles refrigerated and clearly dated.

• Use base-spirit batching to streamline execution. Example: For a local gin sour, batch the gin, liqueur, and syrup. Add lemon and egg white à la minute. This keeps flavor integrity high.

• Build a margin buffer by using distributor kickbacks from your house pours to offset the higher cost of seasonal specials. That keeps your program nimble without pushing your 23% cost cap.

• Train Level 2 staff on execution standards, but keep prep and batching managed by your lead or designated prep shift. The fewer people touching your mise, the tighter your consistency.

• Treat your cocktail menu like a living conversation — rotate intelligently, build storytelling into each feature, and keep your specs tight to avoid retraining every time the wind changes.

You’re not just running a bar here — you’re anchoring the guest experience in a boutique hospitality brand. Your specs, service, and storytelling need to reflect that.
