Assistant:

Considering your venue’s emphasis on chef-driven seasonal ingredients and the need to maintain execution efficiency with limited prep labor, here’s how I’d approach your spring cocktail menu:

1. Ingredient Strategy
- Build around fresh rhubarb, strawberries, and herbs — infusions and cordials are ideal for capturing flavor while reducing prep-day complexity.
- Avoid volatile aromatics like ramps or green garlic in drinks; instead, mirror those savory notes through herbaceous pairings like thyme, chive blossom, or a hint of white pepper.

2. Batching & Prep
- Dedicate your limited prep window to 2–3 foundational batches:
  - A rhubarb-strawberry cordial (for spritz or sour builds)
  - A thyme-infused syrup (plays well in shaken or stirred specs)
  - A pre-diluted stirred base (e.g. gin-vermouth-amaro for fast service)
- These allow you to deliver complexity during service with minimal assembly time.

3. Build Philosophy
- Favor tight, 3–4 ingredient builds to ensure consistency with moderately skilled staff.
- Stick with shaken drinks for guest engagement and flexibility — reserve stirred builds for slow periods or service bar if needed.

4. Presentation Guidelines
- Garnishes should reinforce the food program while staying replicable:
  - Chive blossoms or thyme sprigs (can be picked and stored ahead)
  - Dehydrated rhubarb strips as a low-waste, visually striking accent
- Avoid garnish work that depends on last-minute prep or precision cuts.

5. Example Spec
Spring Thyme Spritz
- Gin, rhubarb-strawberry cordial, lemon juice, thyme syrup, soda
- Build: Shake first three, strain over fresh ice, top with soda, garnish with thyme sprig

By focusing on batchable components, efficient garnish prep, and staff-friendly builds, you’ll be able to offer a spring menu that reads like an extension of the kitchen — without compromising service flow or consistency.
