## Original Assistant Output
Suggestions included:
1. Peer-led “Mini Masterclasses” during pre-shift  
2. Rotating “Cocktail of the Month” designed by staff  
3. Staff field trips to local distilleries/breweries  
4. Peer review & constructive feedback sessions  
5. Quarterly “Skill Swap” challenges  
6. Recognition wall & peer-nominated awards

## Rubric Evaluation
- **Relevance / Specificity:** Pass – Strongly focused on bar team growth, minimal off-topic fluff.  
- **Actionability:** Tweak – Solid ideas but could use more execution detail (timelines, logistics).  
- **Cost Feasibility:** Pass – Mostly low-cost; field trips might require budget approval.  
- **Inclusivity:** Pass – Ideas accommodate different skill levels and roles.  
- **Operational Risk:** Tweak – Field trips & skill swaps may require coverage planning.  
- **Culture Impact:** Pass – Good balance of recognition and skills focus.  
- **KPI / Measurement:** Fail – No clear metrics to track team growth or culture improvement.

## Improvement Plan
1. Add detailed execution plans:
   - Suggested frequency & duration for each activity
   - Prep & follow-up steps
   - Materials/resources needed
2. Include a simple **Culture & Skills Scorecard**:
   - Staff self-assessment before & after each quarter
   - Peer feedback scores
   - Retention & engagement metrics
3. Add at least one **outside-the-bar** social or volunteer activity to broaden bonds.

## Updated Plan (Post-Rubric)
1. **Pre-Shift Mini Masterclasses** – 10-min skill shares, rotating staff leads, tracked on skills scorecard.  
2. **Cocktail of the Month** – Staff-designed with spec sheet, costing, and NA variant.  
3. **Quarterly Field Trip** – Local distillery or brewery, paired with follow-up menu R&D session.  
4. **Peer Review Rounds** – Staff observe and constructively critique one another’s service once per month.  
5. **Skill Swap Challenge** – Staff trade specialties for one shift (e.g., garnish lead vs. service lead).  
6. **Off-Service Social Event** – Monthly casual meet-up or volunteer activity.  
7. **Recognition Program** – Peer-nominated “Bartender of the Month” with small perk (e.g., shift pick priority).
