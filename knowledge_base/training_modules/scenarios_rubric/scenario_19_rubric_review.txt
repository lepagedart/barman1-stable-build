## Rubric Evaluation
- Relevance / Tone: Pass – Collaborative, chef-aligned, framed as partnership.
- Specificity: Tweak – Specs given, but light on yields, station builds, timing benchmarks.
- Balance Check: Pass – Each dish addressed, avoids cocktail dominance.
- Pricing / Pour-Cost Targets: Fail – No costing or pour-cost anchors.
- Operational Feasibility: Tweak – Mentions batching, but lacks batch sizes or shelf life.
- Layout & Flow: Pass – Logical sequence (spritz → stirred → fizz).
- SKU/Prep Overlap: Tweak – Notes some overlap but doesn’t map clearly.
- NA / Low-ABV Coverage: Fail – No explicit NA or low-ABV pairings.
- Bias (egg whites / batching): Pass – One egg white; balanced.
- Deployability: Tweak – Clear direction, but missing costing, yields, NA fallback.
