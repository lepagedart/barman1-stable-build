## Original Assistant Output
Given your goals to enhance guest engagement and check averages without discounting, here are some strategic cocktail promotions tailored to your venue context:

1. **Weekly Themed Cocktail Nights**  
   - Spec: Rotate themed nights (e.g., Tiki Tuesdays, Whiskey Wednesdays) featuring existing SKUs in creative combinations.  
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Match glassware to themes for added visual appeal.  
   - Method: Stirred, shaken, or built depending on the theme.  
   - Cost Notes: Maintain target pour cost with existing inventory; offer upsells for premium variations.  
   - Service Notes: Pre-select themes for the month to streamline prep and promotion.

2. **DIY Cocktail Kits To-Go**  
   - Spec: Offer DIY kits with pre-batched mixers and garnishes for at-home cocktail experiences.  
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Package ingredients separately with simple instructions for assembly.  
   - Method: Include recipe cards with easy-to-follow steps.  
   - Cost Notes: Control costs by using batched mixers; consider branded packaging for added value.  
   - Service Notes: Pre-portion kits to ensure quick assembly during service.

3. **Interactive Cocktail Workshops**  
   - Spec: Host weekly interactive workshops where guests learn to make a featured cocktail under guidance.  
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Provide all necessary tools and ingredients for hands-on experience.  
   - Method: Demonstrate cocktail-making techniques and encourage guest participation.  
   - Cost Notes: Design workshops using existing inventory to manage costs.

These promotions leverage existing inventory, encourage guest participation, and offer experiential value without compromising your brand or margins. Each concept adds a layer of engagement that can attract new guests and entice repeat visits.

## Rubric Evaluation
- **Relevance / Brand Fit:** Pass – Stays aligned with venue’s craft focus, no low-quality discounting.  
- **Minimal Prep / Existing SKUs:** Tweak – Mostly covered, but workshops may need prep load balancing.  
- **Deployability:** Tweak – Execution detail is solid, but lacks ready-to-launch calendar framework.  
- **Program Cadence (6 Weeks):** Fail – No fixed program cadence or suggested rollout order provided.  
- **Operational / Legal Risk:** Fail – DIY Kits To-Go may conflict with state liquor laws and add packaging costs.  
- **Cost / Margin Detail:** Tweak – Needs clearer per-idea cost/margin targets.  
- **Inclusivity (NA Options):** Tweak – No mention of NA alternatives for themed nights/workshops.  
- **Marketing / KPIs:** Fail – No KPI suggestions or guest engagement tracking methods.  
- **Bias (Egg/Batched):** Pass – No excessive egg white or improper batching.
