Tags: scenario_17, leadership, staff_development, team_trust, early_wins, operational_foundations, checklists, kpis

## Original Assistant Output
Week 1 — Establish Foundations

- Observe peak/slow shifts; document workflow pain points and opportunities.
- Review existing SOPs; note gaps or outdated practices.

Week 2 — Quick Wins & Communication
- Implement small fixes from Week 1 (reorganize a station, streamline a prep flow).
- Establish regular briefings/pre‑shifts for communication.
- Menu review: analyze sales mix & margins; identify underperformers and opportunities.

Week 3 — Trust & Engagement
- Launch rotating peer‑led mini masterclasses during pre‑shift.
- Create an anonymous feedback system.
- Start a “Cocktail of the Month” submission to involve staff.

Week 4 — Evaluate & Plan Ahead
- Evaluate changes; gather feedback to refine processes.
- Begin setting mid‑term goals (menu updates or promotions).
- Launch simple recognition/rewards for contributions.

Additional Tips
- Focus on consistency with check‑ins/spot checks; stay visible on the floor.
- Keep ownership informed of progress and challenges.

## Rubric Evaluation
- Relevance / Context Fit: **Pass** — Aimed correctly at a first‑time manager; scoped to foundations and early wins.
- Structure & Organization: **Pass** — Week‑by‑week sequencing; clear headings and bullets.
- Actionability: **Pass** — Concrete, low‑cost tasks; immediate execution path.
- Measurability: **Tweak** — Few explicit KPIs; “assess impact” is vague.
- Operational Depth: **Tweak** — Menu review not tied to margin targets; no schedule/coverage adjustments.
- Staff Engagement & Culture: **Pass** — Multiple touchpoints (1:1s, peer shares, feedback loop).
- Risk / Feasibility: **Pass** — Avoids heavy builds and large training programs; realistic time ask.
- Tone & Clarity: **Pass** — Supportive, non‑corporate.
- Bias (Egg/Batched): **Pass** — No inappropriate tilt.

## Improvement Plan
1) Add **explicit KPIs per week** (e.g., close ≥2 SOP gaps; reduce 86s by X%; pre‑shift attendance ≥90%).
2) Connect **menu review to profits** (target pour cost; replace bottom‑10% performers; quick‑win specials).
3) Include **schedule optimization** (align top performers to peak shifts; ensure barback coverage).
4) Publish **one‑page scorecard** weekly to create visibility and accountability.
5) Add **one visible morale boost** in Weeks 1–2 (e.g., small recognition; coffee/pastry pre‑shift).

## Updated Plan (Post‑Rubric)
Week 1 — Foundations + Trust Signals
- 1:1s with all staff; log ≥3 actionable insights; set expectations for pre‑shifts and station standards.
- Observe peak & slow shifts; capture 5–10 friction points (ticket times, 86s, station clutter).
- SOP sweep: identify outdated items; **close ≥2 gaps** this week (opening/closing, comps/voids).
- Quick morale boost (treat at pre‑shift); publish the Week‑1 checklist.
- KPI: pre‑shift attendance ≥90%; two SOP gaps closed; baseline ticket‑time & variance recorded.

Week 2 — Quick Wins + Profit Awareness
- Implement **≥3** efficiency fixes (tool placement, par tweaks, glassware location).
- Launch pre‑shift playbook (10‑minute cadence; micro‑drills).
- Menu review with sales mix & pour cost; flag bottom‑10% items; propose swap/size/price tweaks.
- KPI: reduce 86s by 20%; publish first **1‑page scorecard** (variance, 86s, ticket‑time snapshot).

Week 3 — Engagement + Scheduling
- Peer‑led 5‑minute skill shares; rotate presenters; track participation.
- Anonymous feedback box; readout at week’s end with actions.
- **Scheduling tune‑up:** align A‑team to peak shifts; confirm barback/running support; trial one extra barback on busiest night if ticket times > target.
- KPI: ticket‑time median down 10–15%; pre‑shift attendance ≥95%; feedback response rate ≥70%.

Week 4 — Evaluate, Lock‑In, Plan
- Before/after review on variance, 86s, ticket times, staff sentiment.
- Lock in SOP updates; archive old versions; post station photo standards.
- “Star of Service” recognition with peer nominations; outline next‑60‑day goals.
- KPI: variance trend improving; 86s down ≥25% from baseline; staff survey pulse ≥4/5.

Tooling (live this month)
