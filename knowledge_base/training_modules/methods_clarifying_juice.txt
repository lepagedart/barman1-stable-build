PROCESS GUIDE: Juice Clarification for Bar Program Use

Purpose:
Clarifying juice improves texture, color, and shelf stability. It eliminates pulp, excess solids, and astringency, allowing for elegant presentations and improved batching with citrus or tropical ingredients.

ðŸ”¹ Method 1: Fine Straining (Basic)
Best for: Quick service, removing visible pulp from fresh juices (lime, lemon, orange).

Steps:
1. Juice fruit fresh.
2. Pass through a fine mesh strainer or chinois.
3. (Optional) Follow with a coffee filter for extra polish.
4. Store refrigerated in sanitized bottles up to 48â€“72 hours.

Note: This does **not** remove proteins or pectin â€” use for short-term needs.

ðŸ”¹ Method 2: Gelatin Clarification
Best for: Clarifying pineapple, apple, or citrus juices for batching or presentation.

Steps:
1. Bloom 1 tsp unflavored powdered gelatin in 1 oz warm water.
2. Heat gently (microwave or bain-marie) until fully dissolved.
3. Stir into 16 oz juice (cold is fine).
4. Chill overnight in the fridge â€” do **not** shake or disturb.
5. Gelatin will trap solids; strain through fine mesh or coffee filter.
6. Store refrigerated in sanitized bottles (good for 3â€“5 days).

Tip: Works well with pineapple, passion fruit blends, and citrus.

ðŸ”¹ Method 3: Agar-Agar Clarification (Advanced)
Best for: Professional bar prep where crystal clarity is desired.

Steps:
1. Mix 2 g agar-agar powder with 250 ml juice.
2. Bring to simmer (not boil) while whisking continuously.
3. Pour into a bowl and refrigerate until fully gelled (1 hour).
4. Hang gel in cheesecloth or coffee filter over a clean bowl.
5. Let gravity pull clarified juice (no pressing!) for ~2 hours.
6. Bottle and refrigerate (good for 5â€“7 days).

Advantages:
- No flavor loss
- Extremely clear result
- Excellent for batching and low-waste prep
