Assistant:

Venue: Small, appointment-only cocktail lounge. Guests are served bespoke cocktails based on mood/flavor conversation. High standards.

Client Prompt (Bar Lead):
> We don’t use a printed menu — it’s all bartender-driven based on conversation.
> We get great feedback, but onboarding new staff is a nightmare.
> I need a system that helps them learn our house style and make drinks that feel consistent. Ideas?

Training Focus:
- Flavor profiling matrix
- Reference builds that act like “templates” (e.g., split-base sour, low-ABV stirred)
- Guest interaction training tips
- Internal cheat sheets or RAG-style retrieval for builds
