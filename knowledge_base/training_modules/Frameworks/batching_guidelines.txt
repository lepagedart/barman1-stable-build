Batching Guidelines – Raise the Bar Consulting

Raise the Bar maintains strict batching standards to support product integrity, operational consistency, and waste prevention.

⚠️ General Policy:
• Only batch liquor-based ingredients (e.g. base spirits, liqueur blends, vermouth combos) under normal service conditions.
• Avoid batching non-alcoholic components such as juice, syrups, or modifiers unless explicitly required for a one-time event.

---

🔁 Shelf Life Considerations:
• Never combine ingredients with significantly different shelf lives (e.g. citrus juice + spirit).
• Once batched, individual components cannot be separated — the shelf life becomes limited to the most perishable item in the mix.
• Do not batch anything you wouldn’t confidently serve 3–5 days later in peak service.

---

🧪 Event-Specific Exceptions:
• For off-site events, large-format parties, or limited-use scenarios (e.g. welcome cocktails), batching can include full builds or non-alc components.
• These must be labeled and discarded after the event — never cycled back into regular bar inventory.

---

✅ Best Practices:
• Batch in liquor-only formats where possible (e.g. clarified Old Fashioneds, pre-diluted Negronis).
• Store in sanitized, labeled bottles with batch date and shelf life guidelines.
• Rotate batches using FIFO (first in, first out) and dispose of expired mixes without hesitation.

This policy supports guest safety, product consistency, and streamlined execution while preserving flavor integrity and inventory accuracy.
