TOPIC: Brewery-Based Limited Cocktail Overlay

SUMMARY:
Defines small-scale cocktail offerings for breweries adding spirits service.

Key Parameters:

• Full beer program remains primary revenue driver
• Cocktail overlay limited to 4-6 signature options
• Simplicity and staff training ease prioritized

Menu Approach:

• 3 batched signature cocktails:
    - One tequila base (margarita or paloma variant)
    - One whiskey base (old fashioned or sour variant)
    - One vodka base (fruit-forward lemonade or spritz)

• 1-2 seasonal rotating cocktails (shaken)

Operational Notes:

• No dedicated full bar prep position
• Prep handled by brewery staff trained on simple batching SOPs
• Limited spirits inventory (no more than 15 SKUs total)
• No high-volume egg white or cream cocktails

Profitability Notes:

• Target ingredient cost 18-22%
• Leverage distributor local partnerships for craft distillery cross-promotion
• Pricing aligned to premium beer pricing to avoid undercutting beer sales
