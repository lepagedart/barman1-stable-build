Core Framework

Pour Standards:

	•	Free-pour only permitted with validated consistency tests.
	•	Staff re-certified quarterly on pour tests.

Batching & Prep:
	•	All batching recipes standardized by management.
	•	Batch prep executed in 3-day cycles.
	•	Fresh juices labeled with prep date and discard window.

Cost Awareness Training:
	•	Bartenders taught basic pour costing on key SKUs.
	•	Staff incentivized to minimize over-pours and waste.

Upselling Techniques:
	•	Promote featured high-margin cocktails.
	•	Use storytelling to justify premium ingredients.
	•	Cross-sell food pairings with cocktail orders.

⸻

Operational Considerations
	•	Shift managers review waste logs nightly.
	•	Bartenders responsible for logging off-spec pours and breakage.
	•	Pre-shift briefings include product updates and weekly specials.

⸻

Profitability Notes
	•	Staff bonuses tied to achieving waste targets.
	•	Ongoing coaching on speed vs. precision balance during service.
	•	Clear guidelines for “comp” policy to protect margins.  Managers should control the comping of items until there is a level of accepted trust with the lead bartender(s) and ownership or the GM should be signing off on this delegation if it occurs.

⸻

Relevant Supplier Considerations
	•	In-house tastings scheduled quarterly with distributors.
	•	Use supplier education sessions to build product knowledge.
