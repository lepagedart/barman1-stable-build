TOPIC: Cocktail Batching Calculations

SUMMARY:
Outlines batching strategies to maximize labor efficiency while preserving quality.

Batching Rules of Thumb:

• Batch components with high volume and consistent shelf stability
• Avoid batching perishable juices beyond 48-72 hour shelf life
• Separate dilution (water) from batched spirits unless specified for service speed

Sample Calculations:

• Target batch size: 20 cocktails
• Recipe: 1.5 oz base spirit, 0.75 oz modifier, 0.5 oz syrup
• Total per cocktail: 2.75 oz

Batch Formula:
- Total Volume Needed = 2.75 oz * 20 = 55 oz
- Account for ~5% prep loss → prepare 58 oz batch

Operational Notes:

• Label batches with prep date & expiry
• Maintain prep sheet logs to track volume turnover
• Recalculate batch sizes seasonally as sales mix shifts

Profitability Notes:

• Labor savings increase exponentially above 50 batch portions
• Waste costs decrease when batch prep cycles match sales velocity
