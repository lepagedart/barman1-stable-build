TOPIC: Pop-Up Event Cocktail Program Design

SUMMARY:
Temporary mobile cocktail activation framework for events and festivals.

Key Design Principles:

• Fully batched models mandatory for volume and speed
• Zero fresh prep on-site (all prep done offsite in licensed commissary)
• Visual aesthetic prioritized for viral/social impact

Menu Setup:

• 3-5 highly visual signature cocktails
• Pre-batched into labeled 1-gallon containers per SKU
• Individual portion garnishes pre-skewered and packaged
• Mobile bar design includes branded batch tap system or nitrogen-kegged service

Operational Notes:

• Pre-pour staging station behind primary service point
• Dedicated runner assigned for ongoing batch refill from refrigerated trailer
• Cashless point-of-sale integrated for rapid guest turnover

Profitability Targets:

• Ingredient cost 15-20% (limited perishability reduces waste)
• Supplier-sponsored visibility packages often subsidize batch ingredient costs
• Bundle custom branded glassware as VIP upsell package

Staffing:

• Event bartenders require basic pour service skills
• Pre-event prep team handles 100% of batching in advance
• Visual service training mandatory to preserve brand consistency
