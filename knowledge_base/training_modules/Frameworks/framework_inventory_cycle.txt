TOPIC: Weekly Inventory & Ordering Framework

SUMMARY:
Provides weekly inventory cadence to optimize cost control and supplier incentives.

Weekly Cycle:  (depending on delivery dates from distributors and days of operation for the business, this schedule can be tweaked)

• Monday:
    - Conduct full inventory count.  If a full inventory is scheduled to be done at the end of month, the weekly inventory should be to asses what is depleted and to reinforce the house pars on SKUs.
    - Reconcile previous week sales vs. depletion
    - Identify upcoming events that may drive special orders

• Tuesday:
    - Generate orders based on par level gaps
    - Review supplier promos/incentives before finalizing

• Wednesday:
    - Receive deliveries and update inventory log

• Thursday-Friday:
    - Spot check high-volume SKUs (tequila, whiskey, modifiers)

• Sunday:
    - Prep preliminary order notes for next week based on sales trends

Profitability Notes:

• Weekly reconciliation allows proactive cost control
• High-velocity products monitored more closely
• Supplier volume incentives reviewed monthly
