ðŸ”¶ PROTEIN WASHING (MILK WASHING / CLARIFICATION)
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Purpose:
- Smooths rough tannins and alcohol notes
- Adds body and creamy mouthfeel without residual dairy texture
- Enables clarified cocktails for elegant visual presentation and extended shelf life

Best For:
- Tea- or citrus-based cocktails
- Spirit-forward builds that benefit from texture rounding
- Bottled or batched clarified drinks

ðŸ§ª Standard Method â€“ Milk-Washed Cocktail or Spirit

1. **Prepare wash base** (spirit or full cocktail mix)
   - Example: Infused spirit or a citrus/tea/spirit combo
2. **Ratio**: Use **1 part whole milk to 4 parts spirit or cocktail mix**
3. **Add spirit to the milk** â€” *never the other way around*
   - This prevents premature curdling from acidic ingredients
4. **Slowly add a 15% citric acid solution** while stirring
   - Acid triggers the milk proteins to coagulate
   - Add incrementally and monitor as curdling begins
5. **Gently sweep** through the mixture with a spoon or bar whisk
   - This encourages protein clustering and makes for easier straining
6. **Rest in fridge** for 30â€“60 minutes for full separation
7. **Fine strain** through cheesecloth or coffee filter
   - Strain slowly for clarity, multiple passes may be needed
8. **Bottle clarified product**, refrigerate until use

ðŸ“Œ Additional Notes:
- The 15% citric acid solution provides stable, clean curdling vs. fresh citrus
- Clarified output is shelf-stable up to 7 days if chilled properly
- Suitable for high-volume prep shifts with batching workflows

ðŸ”¶ FAT WASHING (DUCK FAT, COCONUT OIL, BUTTER, ETC.)
â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”â€”

Purpose:
- Imparts savory, rich, or aromatic fat-based flavors to spirits
- Adds texture, complexity, and finish
- Creates signature house spirits for standout menu builds

Best For:
- Whiskey, rum, mezcal, and gin (with complementary fats)
- Creating unique modifiers (e.g., coconut-washed Campari)

ðŸ”¥ Basic Method â€“ Fat-Washed Spirit

1. Melt fat over low heat if solid (e.g. duck, butter, coconut oil)
2. Add fat to base spirit in non-reactive container
   â€¢ Ratio: ~1 oz rendered fat per 375 ml spirit (adjust to taste)
3. Let sit at room temperature for 1â€“3 hours (stir occasionally)
4. Freeze mixture overnight (fat solidifies and separates)
5. Strain through fine mesh, coffee filter, or cheesecloth
6. Bottle and refrigerate â€” use within 1â€“2 weeks

ðŸ§‚ Flavor Pairing Ideas:
- Duck fat + rye whiskey â†’ savory Old Fashioned variant
- Brown butter + bourbon â†’ dessert-style cocktails
- Coconut oil + gin â†’ modern tiki with creamy aroma
- Bacon fat + aged rum â†’ smoky/umami tropical builds

ðŸ“Œ Tips:
- Avoid excessive fat or long infusions â€” can go rancid or waxy
- Always label and date fat-washed spirits
- Chill or shake before use if separation occurs

ðŸ’¡ Pro Tip: Use for Signature Cocktails
â€¢ Combine these methods with batching for standout house drinks
â€¢ Clarified milk punch or duck-washed rye Old Fashioneds become signature moves
â€¢ Use fat-washing for savory non-alc programs too (e.g., sesame oil + tea)
