Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Encourage creativity with boundaries. Avoid ideas that would slow service or require constant hand-holding. Prioritize delight and operational fit.

Venue Context: A restaurant or bar wants to include one cocktail that surprises guests—either through flavor, presentation, or experience—to elevate guest perception and encourage word-of-mouth.

Prompt: We want to include a cocktail that creates a real 'wow' moment — something memorable, aligned with our brand, and worth sharing. What would that look like without slowing service or needing constant babysitting?

Lloyd's Response:

To create a memorable cocktail that aligns with your brand and delivers a 'wow' moment without disrupting service, focus on a visually striking and sensorially engaging drink that leverages your existing setup efficiently.

### Cocktail Concept: **Golden Hour Spritz**

**Spec:**
- 1 oz Gin (or Vodka, if preferred)
- 0.5 oz Elderflower Liqueur
- 0.5 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
- 2 oz Sparkling Wine
- 1 oz Peach Nectar
- Dash of Orange Bitters

**Ice / Glass / Garnish:**
- Ice: Large cube
- Glass: Stemmed Wine Glass
- Garnish: Edible Flower and Lemon Twist

**Method:**
1. Combine gin, elderflower liqueur, lemon juice, and peach nectar in a shaker with ice.
2. Shake briefly to chill, then strain into a wine glass over a large ice cube.
3. Top with sparkling wine.
4. Add a dash of orange bitters.
5. Garnish with an edible flower and a lemon twist.

**Cost Notes:**
- Target a pour cost of 20-25%, substituting peach nectar with apricot nectar if needed.

**Service Notes:**
- Components (excluding sparkling wine) can be pre-batched in advance, allowing for quick assembly.
- Prepare garnishes ahead of service and store in a chilled, accessible station.

**Rationale:**
The Golden Hour Spritz captures the essence of a refined yet approachable cocktail that plays on the visual appeal of a sunset, perfectly aligned with premium branding. The use of sparkling wine adds elegance and the edible flower garnish provides an Instagram-worthy touch. This cocktail ensures a swift service due to pre-batching while maintaining a high-impact presentation.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:

Lloyd proposed a thoughtful, visually appealing cocktail—but his execution leaned safe, even a bit formulaic, which missed the real opportunity of the prompt:

1. **Too Template-Driven**  
   The “Golden Hour Spritz” reads like a solid wedding welcome drink—not a unique house cocktail that drives guest buzz. A true Wow Factor drink should make guests say, *“You have to try this—it’s wild.”* This one just says, *“That’s nice.”*

2. **No Brand Alignment Without Brand Context**  
   Lloyd never asked or inferred what the venue’s vibe, cuisine, or design cues were. Without that, his recommendation can’t possibly align with the brand. The prompt *explicitly* asked for brand alignment, not just crowd-pleasing visuals.

   - A better approach would have been:
     > “If your brand leans botanical, coastal, or refined casual, this direction fits. But if you’re more industrial, moody, or whiskey-forward, we’d pivot toward a darker, more brooding cocktail that still pops visually.”

3. **Presentation Missed the Opportunity to Surprise**  
   Edible flower + wine glass ≠ “Wow” in 2025. It’s clean, but not memorable. Lloyd could’ve proposed:
   - Smoke dome lift at the table (if bar layout allows)
   - A scent-enhanced garnish (like a citrus peel clipped to the rim with an herb)
   - Interactive glassware (painted rim, dehydrated fruit stir stick, branded ice)

4. **No Social Hook**  
   The prompt said “worth sharing,” and Lloyd included an edible flower—but that’s not a hook. He should’ve added a flag like:
   > “This drink should be plated intentionally with your logo visible behind it—train staff to subtly suggest it’s worth a photo.”

5. **Operational Fit Was Solid**  
   Lloyd nailed pre-batching and garnish station prep. The drink could fly on a busy night without tripping up service. That part held strong.

This wasn’t a flop—but for a signature wow-moment cocktail, it needed a stronger brand tie-in, a creative twist, and a presentation concept that rises above the algorithmic norm.
