Title: Post-Shift Review: Fixing Inconsistent Specs

Tags: consistency, training, checklists, staff_development, operational_foundations

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Replace blame with systems. Deliver a pre-shift checklist, jigger policy, visual garnish standards, and a weekly verification ritual. Include a one-pager staff brief.

Venue Context: High-volume gastropub with rotating bartenders; complaints about the same cocktail tasting different across shifts.

Prompt: Guests keep saying our signature drinks change depending on who’s on the bar. Give us a concrete consistency plan we can roll out this week without hiring a bar manager.

Lloyd's Response:

To address the inconsistency in your signature drinks and ensure a uniform guest experience across shifts, here’s a practical plan you can implement immediately:

### Standardization Strategy

1. **Create Standardized Recipe Cards**
   - Develop detailed recipe cards for each signature drink with exact measurements, glassware, ice type, and garnish.
   - Include visuals or diagrams showing garnish placement and presentation.
   - Store these cards visibly at each bar station for easy access.

2. **Conduct a Team Training Session**
   - Organize a training session with all bartenders to walk through each signature cocktail together.
   - Demonstrate the correct techniques for shaking, stirring, pouring, and garnishing.
   - Encourage questions and ensure everyone understands the standards.

3. **Implement a Quality Check System**
   - Assign a peer review system where bartenders check each other's drinks for quality and consistency before serving.
   - Rotate this responsibility to ensure shared accountability.

4. **Use Consistent Tools**
   - Ensure all bartenders have access to the same set of tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) to avoid variance in drink builds.
   - Check that all measuring devices are accurate and standardized.

5. **Gather and Use Feedback**
   - Place a suggestion box or use a digital system to collect feedback from both staff and guests about the drinks.
   - Use this feedback to make continuous improvements and adjustments where necessary.

### Operational Notes

- **Prep and Par Levels:** Ensure pre-service prep is consistent, with standardized par levels for syrups, garnishes, and juices to avoid variations due to running out of ingredients.
- **Shift Handovers:** Include a brief review of any changes or updates to recipes during shift handovers to keep everyone informed.
- **Visual Aids:** Consider using video demonstrations available on a shared device for bartenders to reference as needed.

By implementing this plan, you can achieve greater consistency in your signature drinks and enhance the overall guest experience without the need to hire additional management staff.

### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Clarify Venue Context and Needs:**
  - Identify the specific venue type and its unique challenges to tailor recommendations effectively.
  - Assess whether the issue is due to high staff turnover, lack of training, or inconsistent supply chain management.

- **Avoid Overreach in Recommendations:**
  - Ensure suggestions are feasible for the venue's scale and resources. Avoid assuming availability of technology or tools without confirming.
  - Prioritize actions based on immediate impact and ease of implementation.

- **Enhance System/Process Solutions:**
  - Introduce a digital platform for recipe management and updates, ensuring real-time access and version control.
  - Suggest a regular review cycle for recipe cards to incorporate seasonal changes or new trends.

- **Improve Tone/Structure:**
  - Use a more collaborative tone, inviting feedback and participation from the team to foster buy-in.
  - Structure the response with clear, prioritized steps, highlighting quick wins and long-term strategies separately.

- **Incorporate Monitoring and Evaluation:**
  - Propose a system for tracking the consistency of drink quality over time, using guest feedback and sales data.
  - Recommend periodic audits by management to ensure adherence to standards and identify areas for improvement.
