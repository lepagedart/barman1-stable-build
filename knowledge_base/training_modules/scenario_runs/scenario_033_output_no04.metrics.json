  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear cocktail recipes with detailed preparation and cost notes. It aligns with the venue's high-touch approach and prioritizes distributor SKUs. However, it could benefit from a brief introduction to set context, a rationale for cocktail choices, and a more consultative tone. The suggestions for improvement in 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' are valid and would enhance the response's effectiveness.",
