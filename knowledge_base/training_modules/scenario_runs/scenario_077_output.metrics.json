  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for reducing citrus waste and ice usage. The plan is feasible and actionable, with specific steps outlined for each week. However, it could benefit from more clarity on the venue context and baseline metrics. The inclusion of a feedback mechanism and risk management strategies would enhance the plan's robustness. Overall, it aligns well with the goal but could be improved with more detailed context and engagement strategies.",
