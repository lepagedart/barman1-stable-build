Title: New Seasonal Item R&D

Tags: menu_design, seasonal, r_and_d, cocktail_creation

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Approach cocktail development as a collaborative R&D process, balancing creativity with service feasibility.

Venue Context: A full-service restaurant wants to add a seasonal cocktail to their menu. Recipes should be original but executable by a professional bar team within a seasonal prep window.

Prompt: We need to design a new seasonal cocktail that balances creativity with operational feasibility. What would you suggest?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing: Guest profile and venue context—without these, it's unclear if the drink fits the target demographic or brand ethos.
- Overreach: "Premium driver" claim is unsupported; no comparison to other menu items or guest willingness to pay $18.
- System: Specify backup plan for apricot availability (fresh and liqueur), and clarify if/when to switch garnish (e.g., dried apricot) for consistency.
- Process: Add explicit allergen and dietary flagging for honey and possible cross-contamination (cloves/cinnamon).
- Menu Cohesion: Reference how this drink complements or contrasts with existing menu items.
- Service Speed: Large cube and garnish may slow service; suggest batching or pre-slicing apricots, and clarify if cinnamon dusting is prepped or à la minute.
- Training: Provide a brief, stepwise training script for staff (e.g., key talking points, troubleshooting balance).
- Tone/Structure: Use more bullet points for prep/workflow; separate cost/pricing rationale from storytelling for clarity.
