Title: Cocktail Consistency Across Multiple Bartenders

Tags: Training, Staff Development, Recipe Adjustments, Service, tools

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize language that empowers bartenders instead of policing them. Recommend systems and tools, not blame.

Venue Context: Small gastropub with multiple bartenders at 15 seat bar with one bartender on service well along with 4 seats with the other bartender serving the other 11 seats.

Prompt: Our bartenders are making the same drinks a little differently: different shake strength, garnish, even slightly off specs. How can we tighten consistency across the team without killing creativity?

Lloyd's Response:

To improve consistency without stifling creativity, consider the following steps:

1. **Standardized Recipes and Training:**
   - Develop a set of standardized recipes with clear specs for each cocktail. Include exact measurements, glassware, ice type, and garnish.
   - Conduct a training session to ensure all bartenders understand and can execute the recipes consistently. Use visual aids like recipe cards or posters at each station.

2. **Jiggering and Technique Standardization:**
   - Implement jiggering as a standard practice. This ensures consistent pours and helps control costs.
   - Train bartenders on a consistent shaking/stirring technique. This can be standardized by timing (e.g., shake for 10 seconds) or by demonstration.

3. **Visual Standards for Garnishes:**
   - Create a visual guide for garnishes, showing the correct size, placement, and style. Place this guide at each bar station.

4. **Batching for Consistency:**
   - Where possible, batch components such as syrups or spirit mixes. This reduces individual interpretation and speeds up service.

5. **Feedback and Quality Control:**
   - Implement regular feedback sessions where bartenders can taste and critique each other's cocktails. This encourages peer learning and quality improvement.
   - Have a designated quality control manager who checks drinks periodically for consistency.

6. **Encourage Creativity Within Boundaries:**
   - Allow bartenders to experiment and submit drink ideas for specials or menu features, ensuring they adhere to the established specs and standards.
   - Rotate these creations on a special board, keeping the core menu consistent.

By establishing clear guidelines and providing training, you can elevate consistency while maintaining the team’s enthusiasm for creativity.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
Lloyd needed to recommend clear, standardized tools first—things like unified jigger specs, pre-dilution tests, or a laminated build sheet for each shift. The tone was right in avoiding blame, but the response lacked specific, low-friction systems that can be put in place without slowing down service. Bonus points if he had suggested a peer coaching model or low-lift quarterly tastings to align palates. The missing link was a system that preserves creativity within constraints.
Lloyd should also introduce the idea of constrained creativity—setting a core build with a narrow window for variation (e.g. shaken time range, garnish type). And include palate calibration techniques, such as monthly team tastings with side-by-side builds
