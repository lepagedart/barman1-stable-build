Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Profitability Lens

Venue Context: A neighborhood gastropub is running with a very limited cocktail menu (only 6 items). Owner wants to maximize profit without alienating regulars.

Prompt: How should we engineer a small 6-item cocktail list to maximize profitability and guest satisfaction at a gastropub with strong regulars?

Lloyd's Response:

For a gastropub with a loyal regular customer base, the cocktail list should be approachable yet innovative, emphasizing both classic appeal and slight twists to keep guests intrigued. Here's a practical approach to engineering a profitable and satisfying 6-item cocktail menu:

### Cocktail List Strategy

1. **Classic Base with a Twist**
   - **Old Fashioned Variant**: Utilize a bourbon or rye base with a seasonal syrup (e.g., cinnamon or maple in colder months). 
   - **Spec**: 2 oz bourbon, 0.25 oz seasonal syrup, 2 dashes Angostura bitters.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Rocks glass, large ice cube, orange twist.
   - **Cost Note**: Seasonal syrup can be batch-made to control costs.
   
2. **Refreshing Highball**
   - **Gin & Tonic with Herbaceous Note**: Feature a local gin paired with a unique tonic and a fresh herb (e.g., rosemary or basil).
   - **Spec**: 1.5 oz gin, top with premium tonic, fresh herb sprig.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Collins glass, long ice, herb sprig.
   - **Cost Note**: Rotate herbs seasonally to maintain interest and reduce waste.

3. **Sour Category**
   - **Whiskey Sour with a Twist**: Offer a classic whiskey sour with an optional egg white for texture.
   - **Spec**: 2 oz whiskey, 0.75 oz lemon juice, 0.5 oz simple syrup, egg white optional.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Coupe glass, no ice, lemon wheel.
   - **Cost Note**: Egg whites should be optional to reduce waste and labor.

4. **Martini Style**
   - **Espresso Martini**: Capitalize on coffee's popularity for a dessert cocktail option.
   - **Spec**: 1.5 oz vodka, 0.5 oz coffee liqueur, 1 oz fresh espresso.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Coupe glass, no ice, 3 coffee beans.
   - **Cost Note**: Use house espresso to maintain flavor and reduce cost.

5. **Collins/Fizz**
   - **Seasonal Collins or Fizz**: a rotating seasonal fruit syrup to keep the menu fresh.
   - **Spec**: 1.5 oz vodka or gin, 0.5 oz seasonal syrup, 0.5 oz lemon juice, soda water.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Highball glass, long ice, seasonal fruit slice.
   - **Cost Note**: Use local, in-season fruits for the syrup.

6. **Low/No-ABV Option**
   - **Non-Alcoholic Spritz**: Offer an option with a non-alcoholic spirit or amaro.
   - **Spec**: 2 oz non-alcoholic spirit, 1 oz tonic, splash of soda.
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Wine glass, large ice, orange slice.
   - **Cost Note**: Keeps the menu accessible and inclusive.

### Operational Considerations

- **Batching**: Consider batching non-perishable components for speed and consistency, especially for high-volume items.
- **Shelf Life**: Focus on ingredients with a longer shelf life to reduce waste. Seasonal syrups should be used within a week.
- **Garnishes**: Opt for garnishes that can be prepped in advance or reused across multiple drinks. Avoid perishable or labor-intensive options.
- **Training**: Ensure staff are trained on upselling and storytelling to enhance guest experience and perceived value.

### Summary Checklist
- Ensure cost-effective seasonal syrups and garnishes.
- Rotate 1-2 cocktails seasonally to keep the menu fresh.
- Batch where possible to improve service speed.
- Train staff on the menu's narrative to enhance guest interaction and satisfaction. 

This approach balances profitability with guest satisfaction, leveraging the gastropub's appeal to regulars through classic familiarity and subtle innovation.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context:** Clearly define the gastropub's theme, target demographic, and any existing beverage program to tailor the cocktail list effectively.
  - **Customer Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for gathering regular customer feedback on the new menu to ensure it meets their expectations and preferences.
  - **Pricing Strategy:** Include a pricing strategy that aligns with the gastropub's market positioning and customer spending habits.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Complexity in Execution:** Avoid overly complex cocktails that may slow down service in a high-volume setting. Simplify where possible without sacrificing quality.
  - **Ingredient Assumptions:** Do not assume the availability of specific local gins or seasonal fruits without confirming supplier reliability and cost-effectiveness.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Establish a robust inventory management system to track ingredient usage and minimize waste.
  - **Supplier Relationships:** Develop strong relationships with local suppliers to ensure consistent quality and availability of seasonal ingredients.
  - **Staff Training Program:** Implement a structured training program focusing on efficient cocktail preparation, storytelling, and upselling techniques.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each cocktail description to enhance readability and quick reference for staff.
  - **Actionable Steps:** Provide clear, actionable steps for implementation, such as specific batching methods or seasonal rotation schedules.
  - **Engaging Narrative:** Encourage a narrative that connects each cocktail to the gastropub's identity, enhancing the storytelling aspect for staff and customers.
