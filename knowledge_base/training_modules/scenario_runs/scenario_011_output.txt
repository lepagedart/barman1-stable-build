Title: GM Needs Beverage Program Performance Audit

Tags: costing, profit_margins, training, staff_execution, bar_performance

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Avoid technical mixology or menu design language. Imagine you’re briefing a non-hospitality executive. Stick to KPIs and recommendations.

Venue Context: 60-seat upscale casual restaurant with a wine-forward beverage program and a basic cocktail list. The GM handles both FOH and BOH responsibilities and is not a bartender.

Prompt: Can you help me evaluate how our bar program is doing? I’m not a bar guy, but I need to know if we’re leaving money on the table or undertraining staff. Just give me the high points.

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing Specificity: Did not tailor recommendations to a defined venue type, concept, or operational scale. Should have contextualized advice (e.g., high-volume bar vs. craft cocktail lounge).
- Overreach: Mentioned "guest feedback" and "allergen protocols" without outlining actionable collection methods or integration into training.
- System/Process Gaps:
  - Did not provide concrete steps for implementing inventory management (e.g., frequency, responsible roles, software/tools).
  - Lacked a structured approach for sales analysis (e.g., timeframes, metrics, reporting cadence).
  - No mention of how to monitor or enforce pour cost targets in real time.
- Tone/Structure:
  - Too general—should use bullet points for clarity, and prioritize recommendations by impact.
  - Should separate profitability levers from training levers for easier actionability.
  - Needs more directive language (e.g., "Assign a bar lead to conduct weekly variance checks").
- Training Clarity: Did not specify training content, duration, or assessment methods. Should outline a modular training plan with measurable outcomes.
