  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for optimizing a bar layout. It covers key areas like station mapping, reach zones, and collision controls effectively. However, it could benefit from including staff training and safety measures, as well as a more collaborative tone. The response is mostly aligned with the prompt but could be improved by considering venue-specific needs and bartender preferences.",
