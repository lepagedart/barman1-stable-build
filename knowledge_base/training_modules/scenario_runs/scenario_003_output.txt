Tags: training, service, upselling, staff_development, guest_experience, language_coaching, high_margin_builds

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize behavioral training strategies that improve upselling without feeling scripted or aggressive. Responses should sound like advice a real bar manager would give during a team meeting.

Venue Context: A mid-range cocktail bar wants staff to upsell effectively without coming across as pushy or robotic. Management is looking for realistic, team-oriented coaching language.

Prompt: How can I train my bartenders to upsell cocktails in a natural way that increases revenue without turning off guests?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing measurable goals: Did not specify KPIs or targets for upsell rates or guest satisfaction.
- Lacks process integration: No mention of how upselling fits into existing service steps or POS workflow.
- Omits follow-up: No system for ongoing assessment, feedback, or reinforcement of upselling behaviors.
- No guest impact safeguards: Fails to address how to avoid guest discomfort or pushiness.
- Insufficient specificity: Needs concrete examples, scripts, or scenario-based guidance for trainers.
- Structure: Should use concise bullet points for training steps and include a feedback loop.
- Tone: Should be more directive and operational, less generic; avoid vague phrases like "find their own voice" without parameters.
