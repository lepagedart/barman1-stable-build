### Evaluation / Rubric Review
- **Menu Alignment:** ✔ Strong use of local/seasonal flavors (cranberry, maple, walnut). Both drinks clearly fit a New England fall concept.  
- **Operational Efficiency:** ✔ Prep is practical — one syrup, one special bitters, both manageable for a small team.  
- **Diversity:** ✔ Covers a highball (Mule) and a stirred cocktail (Old Fashioned). Nice contrast in style and spirit base.  
- **Guest Appeal:** ✔ Approachable yet interesting. Cranberry Mule offers mass appeal, Old Fashioned riff plays to whiskey drinkers.  
- **Opportunities for Improvement:** Could offer one option that leans lighter/aperitif-style to broaden range. Training notes are solid but could include batching potential for cranberry syrup.  

**Result:** PASS — clear, seasonal, efficient, and tied to venue identity.
