  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for implementing NA/low-ABV options. It includes detailed drink recipes, pricing guidance, and staff training suggestions. However, it could benefit from a brief market analysis and customer feedback mechanisms. The response assumes certain cost and service speed improvements without venue-specific insights, which could be risky. Overall, it's a strong proposal with minor areas for enhancement.",
