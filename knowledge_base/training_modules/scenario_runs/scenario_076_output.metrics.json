  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for improving service flow at a pool bar. The use of a station map and detailed operational checklist enhances clarity and actionability. However, the response could benefit from addressing customer experience and safety protocols more explicitly. The batching plan and speed test goals should be tailored to specific venue capabilities. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with additional focus on customer interaction and safety measures.",
