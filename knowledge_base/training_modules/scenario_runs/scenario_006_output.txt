Tags: seasonal, menu_design, house_specials, high_end, culinary_driven

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Elevate tone and culinary vocabulary slightly. Avoid gimmicky drinks or overuse of obscure modifiers. Assume jiggering and guest storytelling are expected.

Venue Context: A chef-driven venue with a high-touch guest experience wants a seasonal cocktail menu that feels curated and refined. They expect premium pricing and strong storytelling.

Prompt: We want a high-end seasonal menu that feels curated and aligns with a chef-driven concept. What cocktails and strategies should we use?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing Pieces:
  - Did not provide recipes for house-made syrups (Spiced Pear, Blackberry), which are referenced in specs.
  - Lacks allergen or dietary notes for each cocktail.
  - No guidance on glassware/ingredient substitutions for high-volume or limited-resource venues.
  - No explicit mention of how these cocktails integrate with the chefâ€™s current menu items or flavor profiles.
  - No mention of staff training or briefing process for rollout.
- System/Process Solutions:
  - Include batch/prep recipes for all syrups, with yield and storage instructions.
  - Add a prep/production schedule for mise en place and daily juicing.
  - Suggest a standardized cost-tracking template for ongoing pour cost monitoring.
  - Recommend a feedback loop: post-launch, gather bar/guest feedback and adjust menu accordingly.
- Tone/Structure Guidance:
  - Use more concise, bullet-pointed operational notes for easier staff reference.
  - Separate guest-facing descriptions from internal specs for clarity.
  - Add a summary table for quick-glance specs, costs, and prep needs.
  - Ensure rationale ties directly to both culinary alignment and operational impact.
