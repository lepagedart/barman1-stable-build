Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Refresh

Tags: portfolio_matching, cost_control, profit_margins, menu_design, supplier_relationships

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame ideas through supplier alignment. Tie each cocktail to a portfolio product, note incentive assumptions, and include a simple cost/price table with target pour %.

Venue Context: Downtown bistro that buys through a single distributor; rep is pushing a set of seasonal SKUs (aperitivo, amaro, rye whiskey, orange liqueur).

Prompt: We want a small seasonal refresh that uses our distributor’s priority SKUs so we can negotiate better pricing. Give us 4 builds that won’t slow service and still feel on-brand.

Lloyd's Response:

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include a brief introduction to set context for the venue's specific needs and goals.
  - Provide a rationale for each cocktail choice in relation to the venue's target demographic and brand identity.
  - Offer alternative ingredients or methods for venues with different equipment or supplier constraints.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid assuming the venue's storage capabilities (e.g., "stored in reach Zone A/B") without confirming their layout and capacity.
  - Refrain from specifying exact pour costs without detailed venue-specific financial data.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Implement a feedback loop for bartenders to report on the practicality and customer reception of the new cocktails.
  - Suggest a training session for staff to ensure consistency in cocktail preparation and presentation.
  - Recommend a trial period for the new menu items to assess performance before full implementation.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more consultative tone by asking questions to engage the client in the decision-making process (e.g., "Would this align with your current menu strategy?").
  - Structure the response to highlight key benefits and potential challenges of each cocktail, aiding the client in making informed decisions.
  - Conclude with a summary of next steps or a call to action, such as scheduling a follow-up meeting to review initial results.
