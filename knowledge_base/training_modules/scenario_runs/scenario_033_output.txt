Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Refresh

Tags: portfolio_matching, cost_control, profit_margins, menu_design, supplier_relationships

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame ideas through supplier alignment. Tie each cocktail to a portfolio product, note incentive assumptions, and include a simple cost/price table with target pour %.

Venue Context: Downtown bistro that buys through a single distributor; rep is pushing a set of seasonal SKUs (aperitivo, amaro, rye whiskey, orange liqueur).

Prompt: We want a small seasonal refresh that uses our distributor’s priority SKUs so we can negotiate better pricing. Give us 4 builds that won’t slow service and still feel on-brand.

Lloyd's Response:

To help you refresh your seasonal cocktail menu while prioritizing your distributor's SKUs for better pricing, I'll suggest four builds that maintain quality and efficiency. These cocktails will align with your venue's high-touch, chef-driven approach, without compromising service speed.

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Venue Context: Clearly define the venue's style, target demographic, and any specific constraints or opportunities (e.g., outdoor seating, specific cuisine pairings).
  - Distributor Relationship: Detail the specific SKUs that need prioritization and why, including any contractual obligations or incentives.
  - Seasonal Ingredients: Highlight any locally sourced or seasonal ingredients that could enhance the menu's appeal.

- **Overreach:**
  - Assumptions on Venue Standards: Avoid assuming the venue's standards for service speed and quality without explicit confirmation.
  - Ingredient Availability: Verify the availability of suggested ingredients, especially seasonal ones, to ensure feasibility.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Inventory Management: Implement a tracking system for SKUs to monitor usage and reorder levels, ensuring priority SKUs are always in stock.
  - Staff Training: Develop a training module for staff to efficiently execute new cocktail builds, focusing on speed and consistency.
  - Feedback Loop: Establish a mechanism for regular feedback from staff and patrons to refine and adjust the cocktail offerings.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Clarity and Precision: Use clear, concise language to avoid ambiguity, especially in specs and methods.
  - Consistent Structure: Maintain a consistent format for each cocktail description to enhance readability and ease of use.
  - Professional Tone: Adopt a professional yet approachable tone, balancing technical detail with engaging storytelling for each cocktail.
