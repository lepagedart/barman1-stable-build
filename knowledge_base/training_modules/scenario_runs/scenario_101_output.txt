Title: Casual Restaurant without Dedicated Bar Manager

Tags: Inexperienced Bartenders, menu design, Training, implementation, Execution, perceived value, Lack of training program

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: Casual mid-sized restaurant with a neighborhood following. Beer and wine program is established, but the cocktail menu is basic and underperforming. No full-time bar manager — the bar is overseen by the GM, who also handles floor operations.

Prompt: We don’t have a bar manager and our staff mostly serves or pours wine. But I still want a cocktail list that makes money and isn’t embarrassing. Where do we even start?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- Missing Pieces:
  - Did not address venue context, guest demographics, or brand identity—menu may not align with venue goals.
  - Lacks process for ongoing menu evaluation (e.g., sales tracking, guest feedback).
  - No mention of allergen management, responsible service, or compliance with local regulations.
  - Overlooks potential cross-utilization of ingredients with existing menu to minimize waste.
  - No guidance on pricing strategy or margin analysis beyond pour cost.
- System/Process Solutions:
  - Implement a feedback loop: schedule regular reviews of menu performance and staff feedback.
  - Standardize recipe cards and prep sheets for training and consistency.
  - Suggest a simple inventory tracking system to monitor usage and minimize shrinkage.
  - Recommend a basic training checklist and sign-off process for new staff.
- Tone/Structure Guidance:
  - Use concise, bullet-pointed action steps for each section.
  - Prioritize clarity and operational feasibility—avoid generic statements like "focus on basics."
  - Tailor recommendations to venue type and brand positioning.
  - Include a summary action plan at the end for quick reference.
