  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps to reduce cocktail pour costs while maintaining guest sentiment. The response is clear and feasible, with practical examples and a focus on key performance indicators. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest experience and staff training, as well as a communication strategy to inform guests about changes. The suggestions for ingredient swaps and simplified offerings are practical but should consider potential impacts on brand perception. Overall, the response aligns well with the goals but could be enhanced with additional considerations for implementation and feedback mechanisms.",
