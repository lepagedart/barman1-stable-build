Title: Cocktail Costing for Margin Protection

Tags: costing, pricing, recipe_adjustments, profit_margins

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Provide clear, numbers-based costing guidance using standard formulas. Balance financial advice with practical service considerations.

Venue Context: A mid-tier restaurant with a cocktail-forward bar program. Management wants stronger margins without alienating guests.

Prompt: How should we evaluate and adjust cocktail pricing and specs so that margins are protected while guests still feel good about value?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing: No reference to specific venue context, guest profile, or brand positioning—recommend tailoring recommendations to venue type and target demographic.
- Overreach: “Reduce portion size” and “substitute ingredients” can risk guest dissatisfaction and brand dilution—should include guest impact assessment and test batches before rollout.
- System/Process: Should formalize a recurring margin review process (e.g., quarterly pour cost audits, scheduled menu engineering meetings).
- Menu Cohesion: Lacks guidance on maintaining overall menu balance when making changes (e.g., ensuring flavor profiles and spirit categories remain diverse).
- Training: Pre-shift training is mentioned, but lacks detail—should specify training materials, tasting sessions, and feedback loops.
- Communication: Menu updates should include scripting for staff to explain changes to guests, preserving perceived value.
- Structure: Use bullet points for clarity and actionability; avoid long paragraphs and generic language.
- Tone: Should be more directive and concise; avoid passive phrasing (“Consider,” “Look for opportunities”).
