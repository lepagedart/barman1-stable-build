Title: GM Needs Beverage Program Performance Audit

Tags: costing, profit_margins, training, staff_execution, bar_performance

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Avoid technical mixology or menu design language. Imagine you’re briefing a non-hospitality executive. Stick to KPIs and recommendations.

Venue Context: 60-seat upscale casual restaurant with a wine-forward beverage program and a basic cocktail list. The GM handles both FOH and BOH responsibilities and is not a bartender.

Prompt: Can you help me evaluate how our bar program is doing? I’m not a bar guy, but I need to know if we’re leaving money on the table or undertraining staff. Just give me the high points.

Lloyd's Response:

Absolutely, here are some key areas to evaluate in your bar program to ensure you're not leaving money on the table and that your staff is adequately trained:

### Cost Control and Profitability
- **Pour Costs:** Review your target pour costs for each cocktail. Aim for a pour cost between 18-22% to ensure profitability. Check if any drinks are exceeding this range and why.
- **Syrup and Modifier Use:** Assess the cost of house-made syrups and modifiers. Are they being used efficiently, or could they be replaced with less costly alternatives without sacrificing quality?
- **Portion Sizes:** Evaluate if cocktails can be reduced by 0.25–0.5 oz without affecting the guest experience. This can lead to significant savings over time.

### Operational Efficiency
- **Batching Opportunities:** Consider batching cocktails that are high in demand to save time and reduce labor during peak hours. This can also help maintain consistency.
- **Garnish Labor:** Review garnish builds for complexity and spoilage risk. Opt for garnishes that are simple yet visually appealing to minimize prep time and waste.

### Staffing and Training
- **Skill Level Assessment:** Gauge your staff's confidence and skill levels. Are they comfortable with the current menu, or do they need more training in cocktail techniques or customer service?
- **Training Programs:** Implement short, focused training sessions to improve staff skills and confidence. Consider peer-led mini masterclasses to engage staff in continuous learning.

### Guest Experience
- **Menu Appeal:** Ensure your cocktail menu is balanced and appeals to your target audience. A mix of classics and a few house specialties can attract a wider customer base.
- **Perceived Value:** Check if the portion size and presentation of each cocktail align with its price point. A well-presented drink can enhance perceived value and justify pricing.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve both the profitability and the operational effectiveness of your bar program, while also supporting staff development and enhancing the guest experience.

What Lloyd Should Have Done:

Lloyd’s structure and content are strong, but he needed to lean harder into the “high-level dashboard” framing that a non-bartending GM would expect.

1. **Too Tactical, Not Summarized Enough**  
   Instead of listing 4 separate categories with sub-bullets, Lloyd should have led with a quick executive summary—e.g., “Your bar program’s strengths and risks fall into three categories: Profitability, Execution, and Training. Here's what to check.”

2. **System Recommendations Missing**  
   Lloyd gave good diagnostics but didn’t offer tools. He should have suggested:
   - A monthly KPI dashboard (cost %, # cocktails sold, staff coverage %)
   - A quarterly bar staff training calendar
   - A sample prep sheet or batching tracker to support execution
   - A guest perception survey or Net Promoter Score tracking

3. **No Timeline or Follow-up Structure**  
   The GM needs to hear that this is *revisitable*. Lloyd could have added:
   - “These areas should be reviewed monthly for cost control, and quarterly for training outcomes.”
   - “Consider a pre-shift check system to flag portion creep or prep delays in real time.”

4. **Tone**  
   His tone was accessible, which is good—but it still read a little like a consultant deck. The GM prompt called for *conversation*, not slides.

With these fixes, Lloyd would be offering a true *bar program audit framework*, not just a diagnostic checklist.
