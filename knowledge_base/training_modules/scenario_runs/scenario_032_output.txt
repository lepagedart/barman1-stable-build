Tags: launch_strategy, training, batching, staff_onboarding, prep_efficiency

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Deliver a day-by-day countdown plan focusing on menu finalization, batch math, par levels, staff training blocks, and go-live checklists. Avoid cocktail theory—stay tactical.

Venue Context: New coastal brasserie opening in 14 days; small team with mixed experience; limited dry storage; soft opening planned for friends/family.

Prompt: We open in exactly two weeks. I need a realistic schedule for bar prep, batching, training, and soft opening to hit the ground running without chaos. What’s the plan?

Lloyd's Response:

To ensure your bar is ready for a smooth opening in two weeks, let's break down the timeline into key focus areas: bar prep, batching, training, and soft opening. Here’s a structured plan to follow:

### Week 1: Foundation Setup

**Day 1-2: Bar Prep & Inventory**
- Organize and finalize your inventory list. Ensure all necessary spirits, mixers, glassware, and tools are in place.
- Set up bar stations according to planned layout. Confirm all equipment is functional.

**Day 3-4: Batching & Recipe Standardization**
- Identify which cocktails can be pre-batched (consider spirit-forward options).
- Prepare and label batches, ensuring compliance with local regulations. Create a logbook for tracking batch usage and shelf life.
- Standardize cocktail specs for consistency. Ensure all bartenders have access to these specs.

**Day 5: Staff Training - Part 1**
- Conduct a training session focusing on standard recipes, jiggering techniques, and service flow.
- Include a practical session where bartenders make each cocktail on the menu to ensure consistency.

### Week 2: Refinement and Soft Opening

**Day 6-7: Staff Training - Part 2**
- Run mock service drills to simulate real service conditions. Focus on speed, accuracy, and teamwork.
- Provide feedback and adjust based on performance. Reinforce the importance of consistent presentation and taste.

**Day 8: Final Bar Setup**
- Fine-tune station setups based on feedback from mock services. Adjust bottle placement and tool accessibility to minimize bartender movement.
- Ensure all batching preparations are restocked and ready for service.

**Day 9-10: Soft Opening Preparation**
- Conduct a soft opening for staff, friends, or a limited guest list to stress-test the system.
- Gather feedback from guests and staff to identify any last-minute adjustments needed.

**Day 11-12: Final Adjustments and Restock**
- Implement any necessary changes based on soft opening feedback.
- Conduct a restock of all essentials to ensure readiness for opening day.

**Day 13: Final Training and Team Briefing**
- Hold a final team meeting to review any new changes, answer questions, and ensure everyone is aligned on expectations.
- Emphasize team communication and support to handle any unexpected issues smoothly.

**Day 14: Soft Launch**
- Open to a limited guest list to manage any unforeseen challenges without the pressure of a full house.
- Continue to gather feedback and make incremental improvements.

### Summary Checklist
- [ ] Inventory and bar setup completed
- [ ] Batching and recipe standardization finalized
- [ ] Two-part staff training conducted
- [ ] Mock service and soft opening executed
- [ ] Final adjustments based on feedback implemented

This schedule should provide a structured approach to ensure your team is well-prepared, minimizing chaos and maximizing readiness for a successful opening.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include a detailed risk assessment for potential issues (e.g., supplier delays, equipment failures) and contingency plans.
  - Address regulatory compliance checks beyond batching (e.g., health and safety inspections).
  - Incorporate customer service training to ensure staff are prepared for guest interactions.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid assuming all venues can batch cocktails; suggest assessing venue-specific capabilities and local regulations first.
  - Do not presume all staff are at the same skill level; propose tailored training sessions based on individual assessments.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Implement a feedback loop system where staff can continuously report issues or improvements post-opening.
  - Introduce a digital inventory management system to streamline stock tracking and ordering processes.
  - Suggest a post-opening review meeting to evaluate the launch and plan for ongoing operations.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use more direct language for action items (e.g., "Ensure" instead of "Confirm").
  - Structure the plan with clear, actionable steps and responsible parties for each task.
  - Maintain a professional yet approachable tone to encourage engagement and adherence to the plan.
