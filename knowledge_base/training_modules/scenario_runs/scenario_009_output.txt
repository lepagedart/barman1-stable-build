Title: M&D Constraints (Single Spirit Focus)

Tags: training, staff_onboarding, bar_basics, communication

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: When the user is building a new menu around one spirit (e.g., tequila), avoid common riffs unless requested. Suggest bold, original builds and ensure cohesion across the menu.

Venue Context: A modern Latin American restaurant is launching a cocktail menu built primarily around tequila and related agave spirits. They want creative but practical builds for their launch.

Prompt: We want to build a tequila-forward cocktail menu that avoids clichés and shows off originality while still being practical. What would you suggest?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing Pieces:
  - Did not address venue context, target demographic, or brand alignment—menu may not fit all venues.
  - No explicit cost breakdowns or margin analysis for each drink; only vague cost notes.
  - Lacks batching/prep instructions or estimated service times for each cocktail.
  - No mention of allergen or dietary considerations (egg white in Sour).
  - No guidance on staff training or rollout process.
- System/Process Solutions:
  - Add a standardized template for each cocktail: spec, prep steps, batchability, cost/margin, allergen notes.
  - Include a section on staff training: tasting notes, talking points, and troubleshooting.
  - Provide a batching/prep guide and par levels for high-volume service.
  - Suggest a feedback loop for post-launch menu adjustments.
- Tone/Structure Guidance:
  - Use concise, bullet-pointed summaries for each cocktail and strategy point.
  - Clearly separate operational notes from guest-facing descriptions.
  - Avoid overreliance on subjective terms ("sophisticated guest experience"); ground in measurable outcomes.
  - Ensure all recommendations are actionable and venue-specific.
