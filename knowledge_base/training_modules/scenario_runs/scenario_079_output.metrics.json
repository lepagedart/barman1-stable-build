  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a clear plan for a seasonal menu that aligns with distributor priorities. The response is actionable with detailed steps, though it could benefit from a bit more clarity in separating strategic objectives from tactical actions. The inclusion of market analysis and competitor benchmarking would enhance alignment with broader business goals. The tone and structure are mostly professional, but some sections could be more concise for quick reference.",
