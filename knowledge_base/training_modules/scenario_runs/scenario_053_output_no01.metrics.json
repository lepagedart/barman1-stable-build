  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan for optimizing poolside bar stations. The use of sections and bullet points aids clarity and readability. The response is feasible and aligns with the goal of improving service efficiency. However, it could benefit from incorporating guest experience strategies and staff training protocols, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Simplifying the complexity of reach zones and providing a flexible approach to par levels would enhance feasibility. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
