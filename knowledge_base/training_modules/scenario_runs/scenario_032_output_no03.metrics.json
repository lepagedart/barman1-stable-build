  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear timeline for opening a bar. It is actionable and feasible, though it could benefit from more detailed risk assessments and regulatory compliance checks. The response aligns well with the goal but could improve by tailoring training to individual staff skill levels and incorporating customer service training.",
