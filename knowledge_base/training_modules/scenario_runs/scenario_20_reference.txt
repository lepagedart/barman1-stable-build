**Strengths:**  
- Menu is lean, executable, and tightly aligned to kiosk space constraints.  
- Clear operational thinking: batching, simplified garnishes, minimized glassware.  
- Coverage of different guest preferences (citrusy, spiced, berry, bitter).  
- Cost-conscious approach with consistent ≤20% targets.  

**Weaknesses:**  
- Creativity feels slightly “safe” — lacks a true differentiator cocktail that would give the kiosk a signature identity.  
- Workflow section strong but could benefit from explicit sequencing to make throughput obvious.  
- No nod to non-alcoholic or low-ABV, which might be useful in a kiosk setting with wide demographic.  

**Final Verdict:**  
A well-executed, kiosk-appropriate menu that respects space, staffing, and throughput. Passes the scenario with minor notes for differentiation and workflow clarity. A small creative stretch (without breaking constraints) would elevate this from solid to standout.  Title: Scenario 20 – Compact Kiosk-Style Cocktail Menu (Rubric Review)
Keywords: scenario_20, kiosk_service, efficiency, batching, limited_space, guest_appeal, low_staffing, workflow, na_low_abv

## Original Assistant Output (summary)
Menu of 4 cocktails designed for a kiosk setup:  
1. **Citrus Gin Fizz** – pre-batched citrus syrup, soda topper.  
2. **Spiced Rum Punch** – spiced syrup + pineapple, high batching potential.  
3. **Berry Spritz** – vodka + berry syrup, light & fast build.  
4. **Pre-Batched Negroni** – classic equal-parts batch for speed and shelf life.  

Ops strategy: pre-batched syrups and mixes, minimal garnish/glassware variety, under-60s build time, efficient fridge/storage layout.

## Rubric Evaluation
- **Relevance / Tone (constructive, not dismissive):** Pass – Advice aligns to kiosk limitations; tone is collaborative.  
- **Specificity (actionable, not generic):** Pass/Tweak – Clear specs and batching notes; could use shelf-life detail for each prep and tighter cost guardrails.  
- **Balance Check (categories, flavor range):** Pass – Range covers bright, tropical, berry, and stirred spirit-forward. Good differentiation from beer/wine.  
- **Pricing / Pour-Cost Targets:** Tweak – Mentions % targets but lacks explicit per-drink menu pricing or cost-band guidance.  
- **Operational Feasibility:** Pass – Strong batching strategy, <60s build times, realistic glassware/garnish scope.  
- **Layout & Flow (readability, grouping):** Pass/Tweak – Functional, but menu flow could be ordered (refreshing → tropical → spritz → stirred).  
- **SKU/Prep Overlap (efficiency):** Pass – Syrup batching and overlap implied; could be clearer about shared base syrups.  
- **NA / Low-ABV Coverage:** Tweak – No explicit NA/low-ABV alternative suggested.  
- **Bias (egg whites / batching dogma):** Pass – Stayed within kiosk constraints, no overcomplication.  
- **Deployability (what to do tomorrow):** Pass/Tweak – Staff could action immediately; needs rollout checklist.  

**Score:** 21 / 25 (Pass)

## Improvement Plan
1. **Add Pricing Guardrails**  
   - Kiosk positioning: **$11–$13** pricing; **≤20% pour cost**.  
   - Set clear menu-mix goals: top 2 cocktails should drive ≥40% of sales.  

2. **Tighten Shelf-Life & Prep Notes**  
   - Citrus & berry syrups: 3–4 days.  
   - Spiced syrup: 5–7 days.  
   - Pre-batched Negroni: up to 1 month refrigerated.  

3. **Expand Efficiency**  
   - Map overlap (citrus syrup covers Fizz + Spritz; berry could cross-utilize as NA soda).  
   - Limit to **3 garnish SKUs** max (lemon wheel, mint sprig, orange peel).  

4. **Add NA/Low-ABV Option**  
   - NA Berry Spritz (berry syrup + soda).  
   - Low-ABV tweak: Sherry Citrus Fizz instead of gin.  

5. **Menu Layout & Flow**  
   - Order: Citrus Gin Fizz → Berry Spritz → Spiced Rum Punch → Negroni.  
   - Include short 6–8 word descriptors and one visual icon.  

6. **Deployability**  
   - 1-week rollout: batch recipes, label system, glassware reset, staff speed-test.  
   - KPIs: Avg ticket time ≤60s, COGS ≤20%, NA/Low-ABV attach ≥5%.
