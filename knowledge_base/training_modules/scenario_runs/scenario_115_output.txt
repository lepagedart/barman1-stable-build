Title: Cruise Ship Flagship Bar – Safe Spectacle at Scale

Tags: wow_factor, event, sustainability, technology, training

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: wow_factor_lens+event_lens+sustainability_lens+technology_lens

Venue Context: Large cruise ship atrium bar serving 2,000+ passengers daily. Strict safety rules (no open flame, careful with dry ice/nitrogen). Central commissary supports batching; shipboard inventory + data connectivity are intermittent.

Prompt: Design a marquee, repeatable ‘wow’ serve that is safe at sea and scalable. Provide the service script, fast-prep garnishes, batch spec, presentation hardware that survives motion and cleaning, and an ops plan for intermittent POS/data sync. Add a sustainability angle (reusable elements, low waste) and a training micro-drill for crew turnover.

Lloyd's Response:

**Marquee Cocktail Concept: "Ocean Breeze"**

**Batch Spec:**
- Vodka: 2 parts
- Blue Curaçao: 1 part
- Coconut Water: 2 parts
- Pineapple Juice: 2 parts
- Lime Juice: 1 part

**Ice / Glass / Garnish:**
- Glass: Clear polycarbonate hurricane glass (durable for ship movement)
- Ice: Crushed ice
- Garnish: Dehydrated pineapple wheel and an edible blue flower

**Method:**
1. Pre-batch all ingredients in the central commissary, ensuring a 3-day shelf life.
2. Store in airtight, food-safe containers.
3. Fill glass with crushed ice.
4. Pour 5 oz of batched mix over the ice.
5. Garnish with a dehydrated pineapple wheel and an edible blue flower.

**Cost Notes:**
- Target a 20% pour cost by sourcing bulk ingredients.
- Consider a substitution of blue curaçao with a locally-sourced blue syrup if unavailable.

**Service Script:**
"Welcome aboard! Our signature 'Ocean Breeze' captures the essence of the sea with refreshing coconut and pineapple. Topped with a touch of blue for the ocean waves, it's the perfect way to begin your journey. Enjoy!"

**Presentation Hardware:**
- Durable polycarbonate hurricane glasses withstand ship movement and are easy to clean.
- Reusable stainless-steel straws to align with sustainability goals.
- Serving trays with non-slip surfaces for safe transport.

**Ops Plan for Intermittent POS/Data Sync:**
- Utilize manual order tickets during sync downtimes; train bartenders to note key details.
- Synchronize data during off-peak hours or when connectivity stabilizes.
- Implement a daily inventory check to adjust to potential discrepancies caused by intermittent data syncing.

**Sustainability Angle:**
- Reusable polycarbonate glasses and stainless-steel straws reduce waste.
- Dehydrated garnishes have a longer shelf life, minimizing spoilage.
- Bulk batching reduces single-use packaging waste.

**Training Micro-Drill for Crew Turnover:**
1. **Introduction**: Explain the concept and importance of the 'Ocean Breeze.'
2. **Demonstration**: Show the step-by-step preparation and garnish placement.
3. **Hands-On Practice**: Allow each crew member to make the cocktail with supervision.
4. **Service Role-Play**: Practice the service script to ensure consistency.
5. **Feedback Session**: Discuss any challenges and reinforce key points.

**Summary Checklist:**
- Ensure commissary batches are replenished every 3 days.
- Maintain a consistent training schedule for all crew turnover.
- Regularly check and clean all presentation hardware.
- Monitor inventory closely, especially during data sync downtimes.
- Review waste reduction practices regularly. 

This plan ensures the cocktail is not only a visual and sensory delight but also practical and sustainable for high-seas service.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Ingredient Sourcing:** Specify suppliers for bulk ingredients to ensure consistent quality and availability.
  - **Allergen Information:** Include potential allergens in the cocktail to inform guests with dietary restrictions.
  - **Pricing Strategy:** Detail the pricing strategy to achieve the target pour cost and ensure profitability.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Complexity of Garnish:** Consider simplifying the garnish to streamline preparation and reduce costs, especially in high-volume settings.
  - **Sustainability Claims:** Ensure all sustainability claims are verifiable and align with broader company sustainability policies.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a digital inventory management system to track ingredient usage and reduce discrepancies.
  - **Training Documentation:** Develop comprehensive training manuals and videos for consistency across crew turnovers.
  - **POS/Data Sync:** Explore advanced POS systems with offline capabilities to mitigate issues during connectivity downtimes.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to improve readability and quick reference.
  - **Clarity:** Clearly separate sections with headers for easy navigation (e.g., Ingredients, Method, Cost Notes).
  - **Consistency:** Ensure consistent use of measurement units and terminology throughout the document.

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a feedback mechanism for crew to report issues or suggest improvements.
  - **Customer Feedback:** Implement a system to gather guest feedback on the cocktail to inform future adjustments.
