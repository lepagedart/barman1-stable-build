# Scenario 001 – Basic Menu Build

## System Prompt Mod
Focus on designing a streamlined, efficient cocktail menu for a new bar program. Balance guest appeal with ease of execution. Minimize prep while maintaining flavor and presentation. Provide clear specs, cost notes, rationale, and operational guidance.

## Venue Prompt
Casual neighborhood bar with moderate staffing (2 bartenders). Goal is to create an approachable, efficient 3–4 drink cocktail menu that sets the venue apart from beer/wine only spots. Prep time should be low, and service speed must stay high during peak hours.

## User Prompt
Design a basic cocktail menu (3–4 drinks) that balances guest appeal with efficiency. Include specs, glassware, garnish, cost notes, and operational notes on batching or prep.
