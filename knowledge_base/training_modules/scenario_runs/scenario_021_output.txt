Title: Optimizing Workflow in a Tight Bar Space

Tags: layout_flow, efficiency, ergonomics, service_speed

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Think like a bar architect. Keep advice practical, physical, and operational. Avoid cocktail recipes.

Venue Context: A new urban bar with only 8 feet of back bar and 6 feet of service counter. High cocktail volume expected with 2 bartenders during peak hours.

Prompt: We need to optimize our bar layout for speed and ergonomics. How should we arrange wells, glassware, and stations to prevent collisions and maximize throughput?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing: No consideration of venue-specific constraints (e.g., electrical, plumbing, guest interaction points, or unique space limitations).
- Missing: No mention of compliance with health/safety codes or ADA accessibility.
- Overreach: Assumes batching/prep station is always feasible in small/non-traditional spaces; should outline alternatives if not possible.
- System/Process: Should recommend a standardized bar layout audit checklist and periodic review for continuous improvement.
- System/Process: Suggest modular or mobile solutions for non-traditional/temporary venues.
- Tone/Structure: Use more concise, bulleted recommendations rather than narrative paragraphs; prioritize actionable steps.
- Structure: Should provide a prioritized action list (must-do vs. nice-to-have) for operators with limited resources.
- Training: Should include a brief note on staff training for new layouts and ongoing feedback loops.
