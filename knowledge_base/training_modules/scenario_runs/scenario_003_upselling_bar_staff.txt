## Raw Output (from Lloyd)
To design an effective upselling training plan for bar staff, focus on fostering genuine interactions, educating staff on product knowledge, and equipping them with the confidence to make personalized recommendations. Here's a structured plan:

### Training Plan Overview
**Objective:** Increase average check through upselling, while enhancing guest experience and maintaining hospitality standards.

**Key Components:**
1. **Product Knowledge**
   - Conduct a tasting session covering premium spirits and signature cocktails.
   - Share unique stories or fun facts about each product to help staff weave these into conversations naturally.

2. **Rapport Building**
   - Encourage staff to engage guests with open-ended questions to understand preferences (e.g., "What flavors do you usually enjoy?").
   - Train staff to listen actively and tailor recommendations based on guest responses.

3. **Upselling Techniques**
   - Teach subtle suggestion methods, using phrases like "Many guests love to enhance their experience with..." or "Our signature cocktail pairs wonderfully with...".
   - Practice "add-on" pitches, such as suggesting a premium spirit upgrade or a flavor enhancer (e.g., a flavored bitters or unique syrup).

### Coaching Prompts and Example Dialogues
**Coaching Prompts:**
- "Always start by asking guests about their preferences or if they're celebrating something special."
- "Introduce premium options by highlighting unique features or flavors."
- "When suggesting an upgrade, focus on how it enhances the overall experience."

**Example Dialogues:**
1. **Premium Spirit Upsell**
   - Staff: "Would you like to try your classic gin and tonic with our house-infused botanical gin? It adds a refreshing twist that's been quite popular."
   - Guest: "Sure, that sounds interesting!"

2. **Signature Cocktail Recommendation**
   - Staff: "If you’re looking to try something new, our signature 'Sunset Spritz' has a delightful balance of citrus and floral notes. It's a guest favorite for a reason."
   - Guest: "I’d love to try that!"

3. **Add-On Suggestion**
   - Staff: "May I suggest adding a splash of our house-made ginger syrup to your whiskey sour? It brings out the spice notes beautifully."
   - Guest: "That sounds great, let's do it."

### Strategies to Enhance Effectiveness
- **Role-Playing:** Conduct role-playing sessions where staff practice upselling techniques in various scenarios.
- **Incentives:** Offer small incentives for successful upselling, such as recognition in team meetings or small prizes for the highest sales.
- **Feedback Loop:** Encourage staff to share successful interactions during pre-shift meetings to foster continuous learning.

**Conclusion:** Equip your team with knowledge and practice to make them feel comfortable and authentic in their upselling efforts. This approach not only boosts sales but also enriches the guest experience, making them feel valued and understood.
