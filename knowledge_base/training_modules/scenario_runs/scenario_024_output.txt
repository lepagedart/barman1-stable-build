Title: Cross-Training Beer & Wine Staff into Cocktails

Tags: training, staff_development, consistency, service

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Tone down cocktail geekery. Use plain language training frameworks with immediate wins.

Venue Context: A brewery taproom is expanding into cocktails. Staff is comfortable with beer and wine service but has little mixology background.

Prompt: How can we train our beer- and wine-focused staff to competently handle a cocktail menu without overwhelming them?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- Missing Pieces/Overreach:
  - Did not address operational impacts (e.g., service speed, ticket times) of introducing cocktails to a beer/wine team.
  - Lacks mention of monitoring guest feedback or sales data to assess training effectiveness and menu fit.
  - No mention of profit protection (e.g., pour cost controls, waste minimization) with new cocktails.
  - Overlooks the need for clear escalation paths for errors or guest complaints related to cocktails.

- System/Process Solutions:
  - Recommend implementing a feedback loop (e.g., post-shift debriefs, guest surveys) to iterate on training and menu.
  - Suggest a phased rollout with measurable milestones (e.g., staff must demonstrate proficiency before menu expansion).
  - Integrate a checklist or digital tool for staff to self-assess readiness and track progress.
  - Include a system for tracking inventory and controlling costs specific to cocktail ingredients.

- Tone/Structure Guidance:
  - Use more directive, stepwise language for clarity (e.g., "First, audit current skills; next, select cocktails; then, train...").
  - Add explicit expectations for trainers and trainees.
  - Summarize with a concise action plan or timeline for implementation.
