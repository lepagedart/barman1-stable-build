Title: Speed Rail & Prep Station Optimization

Tags: speed_rail, workflow, efficiency, prep_efficiency

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Stay tactical. Think like a bar manager setting wells and rails for a high-volume night.

Venue Context: A nightclub with 500+ covers per night. Two wells with multiple bartenders working side by side. Guests expect quick service and simple cocktails.

Prompt: We want to optimize our speed rails and prep stations for maximum speed. What bottles and tools should live in the first rail, and what batching or pre-prep makes sense?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing venue context: Did not tailor recommendations to specific bar size, concept, or menu—should clarify assumptions or request details.
- Overreach: Suggested batching without addressing legal/compliance considerations or storage limitations.
- System/process: Should specify a clear labeling system (date, batch, allergen info), and outline a restocking cadence for peak/off-peak shifts.
- Menu cohesion: Did not reference how the speed rail setup aligns with the venue’s actual menu or signature drinks.
- Training clarity: Should provide a visual diagram or stepwise setup instructions for new staff.
- Tone/structure: Use more direct, stepwise language; avoid generic advice—focus on actionable, context-driven steps.
- Profit protection: Did not mention portion control tools or loss prevention strategies (e.g., jigger use, bottle locks).
- Service speed: Could recommend periodic workflow audits or timed setup drills to ensure ongoing efficiency.
