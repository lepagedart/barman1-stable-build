Assistant:

Venue: Mid-sized full-service restaurant with a seasonal food menu, modest bar program, and strong brunch business.

Client Prompt (GM):
> We’ve had more guests asking for non-alcoholic options that still feel like real cocktails.
> I don’t want to run a separate N/A menu, but I do want the offerings to feel intentional and thoughtful.
> We’re not interested in gimmicks — just smart options that sell. What would you recommend?

Training Focus:
- Non-alcoholic specs that aren’t just soda-based
- Encourage batching & reusing ingredients from the main menu
- Talk optics: glassware, garnish, positioning
- Suggest 2–3 versatile components (cordials, verjus blends, etc.)
