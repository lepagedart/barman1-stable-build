Assistant:

For a rooftop bar positioned within a luxury hotel, your cocktail program needs to offer visual drama, refined ingredients, and a memorable guest experience — all while staying executable with a rotating bar team and limited space.


1. Visual-Forward Build Strategy
- Anchor each cocktail around a visual or tactile element: layered color, fog, flower, or glassware silhouette.
- Leverage low-effort high-impact tools:
  - Vertical citrus peels, dehydrated flowers, single sprigs of lavender or mint
  - Smoked glassware using a wood chip tray or dried citrus flame pre-shift
- Feature 1–2 shareable large-format cocktails served in custom vessels — these drive photos and high-margin upsells.

2. Batching & Execution
- Use 2–3 core base batches with citrus/syrup separated and added à la minute.
  - One batch for bright/refreshing (vodka, citrus, floral syrup)
  - One for stirred (whiskey, amaro, vermouth or coffee cordial)
- Keep glassware and ice programs tight: 2 styles max, pre-chilled where possible.

3. Garnish Workflow (1x/Week)
- Collaborate with the kitchen to prep dehydrated citrus, candied herbs, and flavored salt/sugar rims
- Avoid anything that requires per-shift cutting or needs cold holding — go for stable, prepped, and beautiful

4. Example Spec
Lavender Sundown
- Gin, lemon/lavender cordial, blanc vermouth, orange blossom water
- Build: Shake, strain over large rock in etched glass, garnish with candied lavender sprig

Easy to replicate. Fast to build. Visually arresting.

By creating a menu with structured batching, consistent garnish preps, and visual focal points, you’ll give guests an elevated experience without overwhelming staff — and drive the kind of attention this rooftop needs to stand out.
