Scenario 114 – New Opening: No Existing Beverage Culture

Venue Type:
Brand-new restaurant concept opening in a midsize suburban market. Ownership team is strong on kitchen experience but lacks bar background. They’re looking for a fully built, plug-and-play cocktail program with training support and operational systems.

Operational Snapshot:
- 100 seats + 10-seat bar
- No existing beverage staff hired
- Bar layout is complete (3-compartment sink, 2 wells, reach-in, freezer, blender, cold draft)
- POS not yet programmed
- Bar Director role is being outsourced or fractionalized

Cocktail Program Goals:
- Launch-ready cocktail menu with clear systems for prep, execution, and costing
- High-margin builds with room for creativity in future seasonal shifts
- Operationally scalable: must be able to run with inexperienced bartenders and limited barbacking

Menu Design:
- 10–12 cocktails max for launch
- Mix of crowd-pleasers and signature builds
- Citrus-forward, spirit-driven, and low-ABV options all represented
- Specs include batching guides, pour costs, prep instructions

Staffing Plan:
- Initial bar team hired within 2 weeks of opening
- Onboarding will include Barman-1-generated training modules, recipe flashcards, and mise en place charts
- Daily prep assigned to AM bartender; lead support by GM or Kitchen Manager until Bar Lead is hired

Profitability + Costing:
- COGS target: 20–22%
- Pricing guided by local competitive set
- Rebate-based launch SKUs pre-negotiated with two regional distributors
- Batch builds prioritized for top-6 selling cocktails post-launch

Brand Voice:
- Elevated but accessible
- Focus on transparency, locally inspired syrups and seasonal ingredients
- Avoids overuse of cocktail jargon in menu names and descriptions

User Prompt:
We’re opening a new restaurant and we don’t have a bar team yet. We need a turnkey cocktail program that’s profitable, trainable, and ready to launch. What’s your move?

Assistant Response:
You don’t need a bartender — you need a *bar system*. Let’s build one.

Here’s the launch strategy:

• Start with **10–12 cocktails** max. Design them to hit three pillars: guest-pleasing (mule, marg), signature (house infusion or seasonal syrup), and cost-control (low-ABV or batch-forward).

• Write specs that **anyone can follow** — include measurements, prep guides, and service notes for every cocktail. Assume you’re handing this to someone who’s never worked behind a bar.

• Batch smart. Anything with citrus gets prepped in spirit-only blends. That way, even if your team’s green, the hard part is already in the bottle.

• Prep charts, mise en place lists, and **prep station maps** will make onboarding smooth. Treat it like a franchise — one-pager systems with repeatable logic.

• Build the bar to **support success**, not just aesthetics. You’ve got good hardware — now lay out garnishes, syrups, and tools in exactly the same place every shift.

• Lean on Barman-1 as your interim bar manager. It’ll deliver adjustments, staff training refreshers, even rewrite a spec if your distributor drops a brand.

When the right bar hire comes along, they’ll be stepping into a structured, high-margin program that’s ready to evolve — not build from scratch.
