Scenario 113 – Suburban Upscale Casual with Inexperienced Staff

Venue Type:
120-seat suburban restaurant with an open kitchen, full-service bar, and mid-to-upscale pricing. Clientele includes young professionals, family diners, and weekend night crowds. The bar team is green — mostly Level 1 bartenders, some transitioning from serving roles.

Core Challenges:
- New or inexperienced bartenders with limited cocktail muscle memory
- Broad customer base — need to please both casual guests and cocktail-forward diners
- Menu needs to feel elevated but executable

Cocktail Program Strategy:
- 10 cocktails max, split evenly between shaken and stirred builds
- Limit builds to **5 ingredients or fewer** per drink
- Heavy emphasis on **prep batching** and **garnish simplicity**

Menu Composition:
- Low-labor specs with wide guest appeal:
  - Vodka collins with house strawberry-basil syrup
  - Whiskey sour with orange oleo and egg white powder
  - Mezcal spritz with grapefruit liqueur and soda
- Avoid stirred + strained + express + twist builds (too much to memorize + execute)
- Include at least 3 drinks with **full batching** (including modifiers and syrups)

Execution Plan:
- Lead bartender creates and preps all batches, syrups, juices twice weekly
- Each drink has **prep card with photo** and short callout for staff
- All cocktails built in glass or shaker — no complicated bar tools or glass rinsing

Staffing & Training:
- One bartender per 40 guests during peak hours
- Line-level staff trained with flashcards and daily prep walkthroughs
- Bartenders evaluated weekly for accuracy and speed until standards are locked in

Profitability Targets:
- COGS target: 21%
- House spirits contracted for rebate incentives
- Quarterly distributor activations to educate staff and promote new specs

Brand Voice:
- Elevated, not intimidating
- Menu descriptions simple and delicious — “Cucumber Mint Fizz” not “Botanical Green Garden Experience”

User Prompt:
We’re a suburban upscale-casual spot. Our food’s great, but the bar team is pretty green. How do we build a cocktail program that looks pro without overwhelming the staff?

Assistant Response:
Simplicity isn’t a compromise — it’s a strategy. With a green bar team, success means designing a cocktail program *they can actually execute* without sacrificing guest experience.

Here’s how to pull it off:

• **Limit specs to 5 ingredients or fewer**. The fewer variables, the fewer chances for error. Keep your builds clear and repeatable.

• **Batch anything that slows them down** — syrups, modifiers, even spirit blends. If three drinks share a strawberry-basil syrup, you just saved time and training overhead.

• Create **visual recipe cards** — with photos, prep notes, and service calls. That reduces stress and lets new bartenders self-correct during service.

• Design drinks for **the glass, not the ego**. A mezcal fizz in a collins with a grapefruit slice looks sharp and drinks great — no atomizers, peels, or smoking guns needed.

• Let your lead bartender prep and **own the mise en place**. Early-week shifts are for batching, not reinventing specs.

• And when it comes to menu language? Keep it **approachable**. Guests want to feel smart, not tested. “Ginger Spiked Lemonade” outsells “Ancestral Elixir” every time.

This isn’t dumbing it down — it’s professionalizing simplicity. And when your staff feels confident, your guests feel it too.
