Tags: portfolio_alignment, cost_control, supplier_relationships

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame recommendations through supplier incentives and brand leverage.

Venue Context: Martignetti is pushing a new gin brand and offering rebates. The restaurant wants to benefit without overwhelming the menu.

Prompt: How can we feature this new gin in a way that supports the distributor relationship but doesn’t overcommit the bar program?

Lloyd's Response:

To feature the new gin effectively while supporting your distributor relationship without overcommitting your bar program, consider the following approach:

### Strategic Feature of New Gin

1. **Highlight Signature Cocktail**: 
   - Create a signature cocktail that prominently features the new gin. This could be a modern twist on a classic like a Gin & Tonic with unique house-made tonic syrup or a variation of a Negroni using the gin as the base.
   - Ensure the cocktail is easy to make, using only a few additional ingredients that you already stock.

2. **Menu Integration**:
   - Include the gin in at least one other cocktail on the menu to reinforce its presence without overwhelming your inventory or staff training needs.
   - Consider a simple gin-based highball or a refreshing spritz, which can be quickly assembled and appeal to a wide range of guests.

3. **Distributor Collaboration**:
   - Work with your distributor to understand any promotional support they offer, such as co-branded menus or pricing incentives, and leverage these to enhance the gin's visibility and profitability.
   - Use any provided point-of-sale materials to highlight the gin on your menu or bar area, creating a consistent and noticeable presence.

4. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Keep the cocktail builds simple to ensure they do not slow down service, especially during peak hours.
   - Train staff on the unique selling points of the gin, equipping them with a short script to upsell the gin cocktails effectively.

5. **Cost Management**:
   - Maintain a target pour cost of ≤ 20% for the gin cocktails. If the gin is expensive, adjust other ingredients to balance the cost.
   - Use existing garnishes and mixers to keep additional costs down and avoid unnecessary SKU proliferation.

### Action Checklist
- Develop 1–2 gin cocktails that align with your brand and guest preferences.
- Collaborate with your distributor for marketing support.
- Train staff on the gin’s features and upselling techniques.
- Monitor sales and feedback to adjust offerings and maintain guest satisfaction. 

By strategically integrating the new gin into your bar program, you can enhance your relationship with the distributor and offer appealing options to your guests without overextending your resources.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Engagement**: Include strategies for engaging guests directly, such as tastings or special events featuring the new gin.
  - **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a system for gathering guest feedback on the new gin offerings to inform future decisions.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Define clear KPIs to measure the success of the gin integration, such as sales targets or customer satisfaction scores.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Distributor Dependency**: Avoid over-relying on distributor promotions. Ensure the bar program maintains autonomy and flexibility in marketing strategies.
  - **Inventory Management**: Be cautious about adding too many new items to the menu that could complicate inventory management.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Standardized Training**: Develop a comprehensive training module for staff that includes tasting notes, cocktail preparation, and upselling techniques.
  - **Inventory Tracking**: Implement a system to track the usage of the new gin and associated ingredients to prevent overstocking or shortages.
  - **Regular Review Meetings**: Schedule regular meetings with the distributor to review the partnership's effectiveness and explore new opportunities.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, especially in action checklists.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use direct, actionable language to clearly outline steps and expectations.
  - **Balanced Approach**: Ensure the tone reflects a balance between innovation and practicality, emphasizing sustainable practices.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can create a more robust and effective strategy for integrating the new gin into the bar program.
