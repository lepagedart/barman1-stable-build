Venue Context: A city summer festival needs to serve 2,000 people in a day with two temporary outdoor bars. Power and refrigeration are limited.

Prompt: Design the workflow, batching plan, and station setup for two outdoor bars at a 2,000-person festival with limited infrastructure.

Lloyd's Response:

For a 2,000-person festival with limited infrastructure, efficiency and speed are crucial to keep lines moving and guests satisfied. Here's a comprehensive plan focusing on workflow, batching, and station setup:

### Workflow & Station Setup

1. **Bar Layout & Stations**:
   - **Two Bars**: Position bars at opposite ends of the festival to distribute traffic.
   - **Bar Stations**: Each bar should have 3 primary stations:
     - **Service Station**: For direct guest service, equipped with POS systems.
     - **Prep Station**: For batching and restocking, set slightly back to prevent collisions.
     - **Garnish/Finishing Station**: Between the service and prep stations for quick access to garnishes and final touches.

2. **Bar Equipment**:
   - **Ice Storage**: Use insulated bins or coolers; ensure regular restocking from a central ice supply every 30 minutes.
   - **Glassware**: Use recyclable or compostable cups to reduce waste and avoid glass breakage.
   - **Beverage Dispensers**: Use kegged or bottled cocktails for speed; place draft lines or dispensers at the service station.

3. **Staffing Roles**:
   - **Bartenders**: 2-3 per bar for service and garnishing.
   - **Support Staff**: 1-2 for restocking and ice management.
   - **Runners**: Dedicated to transporting supplies between central storage and bars.

### Batching Plan

1. **Pre-Batching Cocktails**:
   - Select 3â€“4 high-volume cocktails that share ingredients to streamline prep.
   - **Examples**: A Gin & Tonic, Rum Punch, and a Whiskey Lemonade. These can be kegged or bottled in advance.
   - **Batch Size**: Prepare in large volumes (e.g., 5-gallon batches) for each cocktail, stored in insulated containers.

2. **Batching Math**:
   - Calculate based on expected peak service time (usually around 3 hours).
   - Assume 3 drinks per person on average, equating to 6,000 drinks total.

3. **Storage & Labeling**:
   - Clearly label each batch with cocktail name, ingredients, and date/time of batching.
   - Store in a cool area away from direct sunlight to maintain quality.

### Contingency Plans

1. **Power & Ice Backup**:
   - Have backup generators or manual tools (e.g., hand-cranked blenders) for power outages.
   - Partner with a local supplier for emergency ice delivery if needed.

2. **Staff Shortages**:
   - Have a reserve list of on-call staff to fill in if any scheduled staff are unavailable.

3. **Glassware Shortages**:
   - Stock extra disposable cups and encourage guests to reuse them to minimize waste.

### Summary Checklist

- Finalize menu and batch recipes 48 hours in advance.
- Set up stations with clear roles and responsibilities for each staff member.
- Conduct a 15-minute pre-shift briefing to ensure all staff are aligned.
- Ensure all equipment and supplies are in place 2 hours before the event start.
- Implement a feedback loop post-event to improve future operations.

This plan should help maintain a smooth operation throughout the festival, ensuring guests enjoy their drinks with minimal wait times.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Guest Flow Management:** Include strategies for managing guest flow and line control to prevent congestion at bars.
  - **Health & Safety Compliance:** Address health and safety protocols, including sanitation stations and staff hygiene practices.
  - **Communication Plan:** Outline a communication strategy for staff coordination, including radios or mobile devices for real-time updates.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Batching Math Assumptions:** The assumption of 3 drinks per person may not account for varying consumption patterns; suggest a range or tiered plan based on ticket type or demographic data.
  - **Staffing Flexibility:** Over-reliance on a fixed number of bartenders and support staff; recommend a flexible staffing model that can adapt to real-time demand.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management System:** Implement a digital inventory tracking system to monitor stock levels in real-time and automate reordering processes.
  - **Training Program:** Develop a comprehensive training program for staff, focusing on efficiency, customer service, and emergency procedures.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a structured feedback mechanism post-event, such as surveys or debrief meetings, to gather insights for continuous improvement.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, especially in the checklist and contingency sections.
  - **Prioritization:** Highlight critical actions and prioritize them in the summary checklist to ensure focus on the most impactful tasks.
  - **Clarity:** Use clear, direct language to avoid ambiguity, particularly in role assignments and operational procedures.
