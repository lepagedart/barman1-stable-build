Tags: event_setup, layout, speed_of_service, staffing, throughput

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Combine event setup + layout lenses: quick-serve stations, glassware flow, ice/mixer totals, and contingency plans.

Venue Context: Hotel courtyard pop-up for a summer launch event. Expect 350 guests in 90 minutes; two bars plus one roving tray team.

Prompt: Design a pop-up service to move 350 guests through Champagne and two spritz SKUs in 90 minutes. Provide station maps, staffing roles, par levels, ice/mixer math, tray runs, and a 20-minute peak drill. Keep lines under 4 minutes.

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently serve 350 guests with Champagne and two spritz cocktails in 90 minutes, a well-organized pop-up service plan is crucial. Here's a detailed strategy to keep lines moving and ensure a premium guest experience.

### Station Setup
- **Bar Layout**: Two main service bars, each 6-feet long, positioned centrally to the guest flow.
- **Station Map**:
  ```
  | Ice Bin | Champagne | Spritz 1 | Spritz 2 | Garnishes | POS |
  ```

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartenders (4 total)**:
  - **2 Champagne Pourers**: Dedicated to quickly popping bottles and pouring Champagne.
  - **2 Spritz Makers**: Focused on mixing and serving the two spritz cocktails.
- **1 Runner**: Handles restocking of Champagne, mixers, and ice; assists with tray runs.
- **1 Support Staff**: Manages glassware collection and cleaning.

### Par Levels and Inventory
- **Champagne**: Estimate 1.5 glasses per guest. For 350 guests, prepare 525 glasses. Depending on bottle size, calculate total bottles needed (e.g., approximately 105 bottles for 750ml size).
- **Spritz Ingredients**: 
  - **Spritz 1 & 2**: Pre-batch each spritz for easy pouring. Mix enough for roughly 1 drink per person per SKU.
  - **Garnishes**: Lemon wheels, orange slices, or herbs depending on the spritz recipes.
- **Ice**: Calculate based on spritz needs, approximately 1 pound per drink plus reserves.
- **Mixers**: Batches should include any soda or tonic needed for spritzes.

### Ice and Mixer Math
- **Ice**: Ensure a minimum of 350 pounds of ice, with an additional 100 pounds reserve.
- **Mixer**: Confirm quantities align with recipe batching, allowing for slight over-prep to prevent shortages.

### Tray Runs
- **Trays**: Use for circulating Champagne and spritzes during peak times. Each tray holds 8-10 drinks.
- **Runner Tasks**: Refill trays every 5 minutes; coordinate with bartenders to ensure constant availability.

### 20-Minute Peak Drill
1. **Pre-Shift Huddle**: Brief staff on roles and expectations. Emphasize speed and efficiency.
2. **Mock Service**: Conduct a 20-minute drill with staff serving each other to simulate peak conditions.
3. **Review & Adjust**: Post-drill, discuss bottlenecks and adjust station setups accordingly.
4. **Final Prep**: Confirm all stations are restocked and ready.
5. **Go Live**: Start service with all stations fully operational and staffed.

### Contingency Plans
- **Glassware**: Keep extra stock available; assign a staff member to monitor and replenish.
- **Ice/Power Issues**: Have backup ice stored in coolers; use manual methods if electrical equipment fails.
- **Staffing**: Cross-train staff to cover roles in case of absenteeism.

This plan should keep lines moving efficiently and ensure guests enjoy their drinks with minimal wait times.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Venue Context & Customization**: 
  - Missing specific venue details (e.g., layout constraints, guest flow patterns). Tailor the setup to the actual space and guest demographics.
  - Overreach in assuming a generic setup fits all venues. Adjust the plan based on venue-specific challenges (e.g., outdoor vs. indoor, weather considerations).

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a real-time tracking system for inventory levels to prevent shortages or overstock.
  - **POS Integration**: Ensure POS systems are integrated for seamless transaction processing and inventory updates.
  - **Staff Coordination**: Use a communication tool (e.g., headsets) for real-time coordination among staff, especially during peak times.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during service.
  - **Actionable Steps**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for each role, ensuring no ambiguity in tasks.
  - **Empowerment**: Encourage staff to provide feedback on the plan to foster a collaborative environment and improve future operations.

- **Contingency Planning**:
  - **Detailed Backup Plans**: Elaborate on contingency plans with specific steps and assign roles for executing these plans.
  - **Scenario Drills**: Conduct regular drills for various contingencies to ensure staff readiness and adaptability.

- **Feedback Loop**:
  - **Post-Event Review**: Implement a structured debrief session post-event to gather insights and improve future service plans.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Establish a feedback loop with staff and guests to refine processes and enhance the guest experience continuously.
