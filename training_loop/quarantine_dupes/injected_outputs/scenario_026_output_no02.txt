Prompt: Guests have been complaining about inconsistent cocktails and some regulars have stopped coming back. How do we reset standards and repair guest trust?

Lloyd's Response:

To address guests' complaints about inconsistent cocktails and work on regaining their trust, you should focus on standardizing your cocktail preparation and enhancing the overall guest experience. Here’s a step-by-step plan to help reset standards and repair guest trust:

### 1. Standardize Recipes and Procedures
- **Develop Standardized Recipes:** Ensure every cocktail has a clear, standardized recipe with exact measurements, prescribed glassware, specific ice type, and garnish instructions. This should be documented and readily accessible to all staff.
- **Visual Aids:** Use recipe cards or posters at each station to reinforce the standards. Include photos to show proper garnish and presentation.

### 2. Staff Training and Calibration
- **Conduct Training Sessions:** Organize comprehensive training sessions for the bar team. Focus on the correct techniques for shaking, stirring, and garnishing. Address any discrepancies in methods currently used.
- **Calibration Exercise:** Regularly schedule calibration exercises where bartenders prepare the same drink to match a 'gold standard' cocktail prepared by a lead bartender or trainer.

### 3. Implement Quality Checks
- **Shift Checklists:** Create pre-service checklists that ensure all necessary ingredients and tools are in place and that bartenders are prepared to execute drinks consistently.
- **Periodic Spot Checks:** Conduct random quality checks during shifts to ensure drinks are being made according to the standards.

### 4. Gather and Act on Guest Feedback
- **Feedback Loop:** Actively seek guest feedback through comment cards or digital surveys. This helps identify issues promptly and shows guests that their opinions are valued.
- **Respond and Adapt:** Use feedback to make necessary adjustments. Communicate changes back to guests, especially regulars, to show you're taking action.

### 5. Build Guest Confidence
- **Guest Communication:**
  - Inform guests of your commitment to improving quality. This could be through social media, your website, or directly in the venue.
  - Offer a complimentary drink or discount to regulars who’ve experienced inconsistencies as a goodwill gesture.
- **Consistency Rewards:** Consider a loyalty program or special offers to encourage repeat visits and reward guest loyalty.

### Action Checklist
- Develop and distribute standardized recipe cards.
- Schedule and conduct training and calibration sessions.
- Implement pre-service checklists and random spot checks.
- Set up a system for gathering and acting on guest feedback.
- Communicate improvements to your guests and offer goodwill gestures.

By standardizing your cocktail preparation and actively engaging with your guests, you can restore consistency and rebuild trust, encouraging regulars to return and new guests to become loyal patrons.
