Title: Speed-Well Redesign for Two-Bartender Service

Tags: layout_flow, prep_efficiency, speed, service_well, menu_design

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize station ergonomics, rail loadout, reach zones, and build-path sequencing. Include a 15-minute peak stress drill with throughput targets.

Venue Context: 80-seat neighborhood restaurant; bar has 10 stools and a single service well. Friday/Saturday peaks with two bartenders on, one focused on service well tickets.

Prompt: Our service well gets crushed on weekends. Can you redesign the well layout and build flow so two bartenders can run without collisions and keep ticket times under five minutes?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your service well layout for two bartenders, we'll focus on minimizing movement, preventing collisions, and ensuring an efficient build flow. Here's a practical approach:

### Station Map
- **Service Well Assignment**: Designate one bartender to primarily handle the service well and the other to focus on the guest-facing well to streamline roles and reduce crossover.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Establish a one-way flow behind the bar to avoid collisions — for example, moving left-to-right or vice versa, depending on your layout.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Place frequently used items like jiggers, strainers, and glassware within easy reach. The speed rail should hold core spirits in the order of the cocktail build.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Store secondary items like juices, syrups, and bitters here. Use speed pourers for quick access.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Reserve for less frequently used items, like extra glassware or backup spirits.

### Rail Loadout
- **Left to Right**: Arrange spirits in the order of most used cocktails — e.g., vodka, gin, rum, tequila, whiskey, liqueurs. Ensure modifiers like vermouths and bitters are grouped nearby.
- **Tools and Dump Sink**: Place tools like muddlers and bar spoons on the far left or right, depending on dominant hand use. Keep the dump sink centrally located but easily accessible.

### Build Path
1. **FIFO Order**: Align the build path from glass to garnish. Start with glassware, add ice, pour spirits, add modifiers, shake/stir, strain, and finish with garnish.
2. **Batching**: Pre-batch popular cocktails or modifiers if volume justifies it to speed up service.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set daily pars for ice, citrus, and syrups to prevent shortages. Label and date all prepped items.
- **Restock Cadence**: Establish a restock routine during lulls (e.g., every hour) to maintain readiness.

### Collision Controls
- **POS Placement**: Ensure the POS system is within reach but doesn’t disrupt flow. Avoid placing it near the busiest stations.
- **Pass Line and No-Stand Zones**: Create designated areas for order handoffs and ensure bartenders avoid lingering in high-traffic zones.

### KPIs & Tests
- **Tickets/Minute**: Aim for at least 2-3 tickets per minute per bartender during peak times.
- **Steps/Drink**: Minimize steps by organizing tools and ingredients logically.
- **Stress Test**: Conduct a 15-minute mock service drill to identify and address bottlenecks.

### 5-Step Action Checklist
1. Reorganize tools and spirits according to the specified rail loadout.
2. Set clear roles for each bartender and establish traffic lanes.
3. Implement batching for high-volume cocktails.
4. Schedule regular restocking and prep check-ins.
5. Conduct a mock service drill to fine-tune layout and build flow.

This layout strategy should help your bartenders work more efficiently, reduce wait times, and handle high-volume service with ease.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include a section on staff training for new layout and processes to ensure smooth implementation.
  - Address potential customer interaction improvements, such as visibility and accessibility of bartenders to guests.
  - Consider safety measures for handling spills and broken glassware.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid overly prescriptive instructions on tool placement without considering venue-specific needs and bartender preferences.
  - Limit assumptions about cocktail popularity and batching without data from the venue.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Implement a feedback loop post-implementation to gather bartender insights and adjust the layout as needed.
  - Develop a checklist for daily setup and closing procedures to maintain consistency.
  - Introduce a digital inventory system to track stock levels and reduce manual errors.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more collaborative tone, inviting feedback and suggestions from the venue staff.
  - Structure the response with a clear introduction and conclusion to frame the detailed recommendations.
  - Break down complex processes into simpler, actionable steps for clarity and ease of understanding.
