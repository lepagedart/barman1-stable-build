Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Clarify Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., high-volume bar, craft cocktail lounge) to tailor waste-reduction strategies appropriately.
  
- **Avoid Overreach**: Ensure recommendations are realistic for the venue's operational scale. For instance, not all venues can implement complex zero-waste techniques without additional resources.

- **Add System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Suggest a system for tracking ingredient usage and waste, such as a digital inventory tool, to identify high-waste areas.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Implement a process for regular feedback from bartenders on the practicality of waste-reduction strategies.
  
- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Actionable Steps**: Break down each strategy into clear, actionable steps. For example, detail how to set up a station for efficient garnish use.
  - **Prioritize Initiatives**: Rank strategies by impact and ease of implementation to guide focus during initial phases.
  - **Engagement**: Use inclusive language to encourage buy-in from the team, such as "we can explore" instead of "you should."

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Cost Analysis**: Include a brief analysis of potential cost savings from reduced waste to strengthen the business case.
  - **Sustainability Goals**: Align strategies with broader sustainability goals, if applicable, to enhance organizational alignment.
