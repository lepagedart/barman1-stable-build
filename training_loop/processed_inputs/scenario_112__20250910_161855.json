  "venue_context": "Major-league stadium concourse. 4 pop-up bars running 90 minutes pre-game + halftime crush. Limited back-of-house, ice delivered by tote, waste streams audited by venue sustainability team. Strict ID checks and service boundaries.",
  "prompt": "Build a throughput plan for 4 pop-up bars that cuts single-use waste and keeps lines moving. Specify batching strategies, clarified juice or stabilized mixers where appropriate, garnish plan with minimal waste, reclaimed-ice policy if viable, and a compliance-forward ID/refusal workflow. Include per-station par sheets and a halftime ‘crush mode’ configuration."
