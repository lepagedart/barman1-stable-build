  "venue_context": "Resort pool bar serving 200 guests in afternoon peak. Hot weather, limited cold storage, and a single ice machine shared with banquets.",
  "prompt": "Our pool bar melts down every weekend when 200+ guests hit at once. Drinks take forever, ice runs out, and garnishes spoil. How do we fix menu and setup so service flies and drinks hold up in the heat?"
