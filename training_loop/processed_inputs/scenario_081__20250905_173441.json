  "venue_context": "High-volume neighborhood cocktail bar (220 covers, 2 stations, 1 service well), peak Saturday 9–11pm. POS went down mid-service.",
  "prompt": "Our POS died during peak and support ETA is hours. How do we keep taking orders, maintain accuracy, control cash/cards, and reconcile later without wrecking the guest experience?"
