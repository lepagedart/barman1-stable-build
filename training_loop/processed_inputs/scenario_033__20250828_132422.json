  "venue_context": "Downtown bistro that buys through a single distributor; rep is pushing a set of seasonal SKUs (aperitivo, amaro, rye whiskey, orange liqueur).",
  "prompt": "We want a small seasonal refresh that uses our distributor’s priority SKUs so we can negotiate better pricing. Give us 4 builds that won’t slow service and still feel on-brand."
