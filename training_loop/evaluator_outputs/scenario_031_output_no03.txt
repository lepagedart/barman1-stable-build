Title: Speed-Well Redesign for Two-Bartender Service

Tags: layout_flow, prep_efficiency, speed, service_well, menu_design

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize station ergonomics, rail loadout, reach zones, and build-path sequencing. Include a 15-minute peak stress drill with throughput targets.

Venue Context: 80-seat neighborhood restaurant; bar has 10 stools and a single service well. Friday/Saturday peaks with two bartenders on, one focused on service well tickets.

Prompt: Our service well gets crushed on weekends. Can you redesign the well layout and build flow so two bartenders can run without collisions and keep ticket times under five minutes?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your service well for efficient operation with two bartenders during peak times, focus on minimizing movement, preventing collisions, and ensuring a streamlined build flow. Here's a practical approach:

### Station Map
- **Role Designation**: Assign one bartender to the service well for server tickets and the other to the guest-facing well to handle direct customers. This separation helps reduce the need for crossover and potential collisions.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Implement a one-way flow behind the bar to avoid collisions. Depending on your layout, choose a left-to-right or right-to-left movement pattern. Mark lanes with floor tape if needed for clarity.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Keep frequently used items like jiggers, strainers, and bitters within immediate reach.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Place less frequently used bottles and tools here. This zone is ideal for spirits used in multiple cocktails.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Store backup supplies and less-used bottles outside of immediate reach to avoid clutter.

### Rail Loadout
- **Bottle Order**: Arrange bottles from left to right based on usage frequency and type. Consider grouping similar categories together (e.g., vodka, gin, rum).
- **Tool Placement**: Position jiggers, shakers, and strainers in a central location within Zone A for easy access.

### Build Path
- **Sequence**: Follow a consistent build order: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.
- **Efficiency**: Use a two-bottle pour technique where possible to save time on builds.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set clear pars for ice, citrus, and syrups. Ensure these are prepped and restocked during slower periods.
- **Labeling**: Use clear labels for syrups and juices to prevent confusion and speed up service.

### Collision Controls
- **POS Placement**: Ensure the POS system is easily accessible without crossing paths. Consider a second terminal if space allows.
- **Pass Line**: Establish a designated pass line for drinks to be picked up by servers, reducing the need for bartenders to move around.

### KPIs & Stress Test
- **Throughput Target**: Aim for 12–15 tickets per minute during peak times.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 15-minute drill before peak hours to identify bottlenecks and adjust as needed.

### Summary Checklist
1. Assign and clarify bartender roles.
2. Mark traffic lanes and ensure one-way movement.
3. Set up reach zones and rail loadout for optimal efficiency.
4. Establish a consistent build path and train staff on it.
5. Conduct a pre-service drill to test and refine the setup.

Implementing these changes should help streamline your service well operations, reduce collisions, and keep ticket times under five minutes.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Staff Training:** Include a section on training staff to adapt to the new system, ensuring everyone is on the same page.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a process for collecting feedback from bartenders on the new setup to continuously improve operations.
  - **Customer Experience:** Address how these changes will impact customer interaction and satisfaction.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Throughput Target:** The target of 12–15 tickets per minute may be unrealistic without context on current capabilities and resources. Adjust based on venue specifics.
  - **Mock Service Drill:** While beneficial, the drill should be more than just a bottleneck identifier; it should also serve as a training and adjustment period.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Continuous Improvement:** Implement a regular review process to assess the effectiveness of the changes and make iterative improvements.
  - **Resource Allocation:** Ensure there are adequate resources (e.g., backup staff, equipment) to support the new system during peak times.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use imperative verbs to clearly direct actions (e.g., "Assign roles," "Mark lanes").
  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical changes and gradually move to less urgent adjustments to guide implementation effectively.
