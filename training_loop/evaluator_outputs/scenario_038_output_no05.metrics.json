  "notes": "The response provides a solid plan for a winter-themed cocktail menu with a focus on batching and simplicity. However, it lacks specific venue context and customer preference insights, which are crucial for tailoring the menu effectively. The structure could be improved with clearer bullet points and more precise instructions. The actionability is moderate, as it includes some operational notes but could benefit from more detailed steps and training modules. Overall, the response aligns with the prompt but could be more tailored and precise.",
