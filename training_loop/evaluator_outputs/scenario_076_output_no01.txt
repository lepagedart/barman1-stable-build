Title: Resort Pool Bar: Peak Hour Speed Without Sacrificing Quality

Tags: layout, event_setup, speed_of_service, batching, guest_experience

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on Event Setup and Layout lenses. Emphasize station maps, throughput targets, batching math, and collision controls.

Venue Context: Open-air resort pool bar with two POS terminals, limited shade, 180 seats, daily 2–3pm surge after pool games.

Prompt: Our pool bar gets slammed 2–3pm; lines reach 20+ deep, ice melts fast, and garnishes run out. We have 3 bartenders and 1 barback. Design a service flow and batching plan that keeps drinks at spec and pushes at least 140 drinks/hour. Include an ASCII station map, rail loadout, ice/mixer cadence, and a 20-minute stress drill.

Lloyd's Response:

To enhance service flow at your pool bar and maintain high drink quality under peak conditions, here's a structured plan:

### Station Map
```
[Service Well]  [Guest Well]  [Guest Well]
  Bartender 1   Bartender 2   Bartender 3
```

- **Bartender 1**: Focuses on service well, handling orders from servers.
- **Bartender 2 & 3**: Focus on walk-up guests, each responsible for one guest well.
- **Barback**: Manages restocking, ice, and garnishes.

### Rail Loadout (L→R for each station)
- Vodka, Gin, Rum, Tequila, Whiskey
- Triple Sec, Simple Syrup, Lime Juice, Lemon Juice
- Bitters, Tonic, Soda Water

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Jiggers, shakers, most-used spirits, garnishes.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Backup spirits, spare glassware.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Bulk ice, extra mixers.

### Ice & Mixer Cadence
- **Ice**: Refill every 15 minutes to prevent melting.
- **Mixers**: Pre-batch common mixers (simple syrup, lime juice), stored in labeled bottles for quick access.

### Batching Plan
- **Batch Liquors**: Pre-batch top-selling cocktails (e.g., Margaritas, Mojitos) with spirits only. Store in chilled containers with a 24-hour shelf life.
- **Mixers**: Prepare a large batch of simple syrup and lime juice daily, stored in squeeze bottles for easy access.

### 20-Minute Stress Drill
1. **Prep**: Ensure all stations are stocked with spirits, mixers, ice, and garnishes.
2. **Role Assignments**: Confirm each team member knows their station and responsibilities.
3. **Batch Test**: Run a practice round of making batched cocktails to ensure consistency.
4. **Speed Test**: Push for 140 drinks/hour pace by practicing rapid builds and handoffs.
5. **Review**: Post-drill, review efficiency and adjust station requirements as needed.

### Operational Checklist
- Assign clear roles to bartenders and barback.
- Maintain a one-way flow to avoid collisions.
- Regularly restock ice and garnishes.
- Use pre-batched mixes for speed and consistency.
- Conduct regular drills to maintain team readiness under pressure.

By implementing this structured setup and focusing on efficient batching and restocking, you should successfully maintain both speed and quality during peak hours.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include a clear introduction and conclusion to frame the response and reinforce key takeaways.
  - Provide context on why these specific processes are recommended, linking them to common challenges faced during peak hours.
  - Address potential customer interaction issues and how to maintain service quality while focusing on speed.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid overly prescriptive details without understanding the specific venue layout or staff capabilities. Tailor recommendations to be adaptable.
  - The batching plan assumes availability of space and equipment for storage, which may not be feasible for all venues.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Introduce a feedback loop for staff to report on the effectiveness of the setup and suggest improvements.
  - Implement a digital system for tracking inventory levels in real-time to prevent shortages.
  - Develop a contingency plan for unexpected high demand or staff shortages.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more conversational tone to engage the reader, while maintaining professionalism.
  - Break down complex processes into simpler, actionable steps with clear headings and bullet points.
  - Ensure consistency in formatting, such as using bullet points or numbered lists uniformly.

- **Conciseness:**
  - Eliminate redundant information and focus on the most impactful actions.
  - Use concise language to convey instructions clearly and efficiently.
