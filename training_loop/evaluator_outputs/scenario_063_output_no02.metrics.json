  "notes": "The response provides a structured approach to optimizing bar service under limited power supply, but lacks specific venue context and power supply details. Recommendations are generally feasible but could benefit from prioritization and more concise presentation. The suggestion of portable battery packs may not be practical without a feasibility assessment. Additional considerations for staffing and customer communication would enhance the response.",
