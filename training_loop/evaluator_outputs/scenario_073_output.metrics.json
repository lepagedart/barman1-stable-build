  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and mostly clear, with actionable steps for implementing a low-waste citrus and ice program. However, some processes like agar clarification may not be feasible for all venues. The response could benefit from more emphasis on stakeholder engagement and measurement metrics. The use of reclaimed ice should be addressed with more caution regarding safety.",
