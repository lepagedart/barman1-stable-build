  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies to address bottlenecks at a pool bar. The recommendations are clear and feasible, focusing on menu simplification, operational adjustments, and an action checklist. However, the response could benefit from more context-specific details and alternative solutions for venues without advanced equipment. The 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section offers useful insights for improvement, emphasizing the need for contextual understanding and structured training modules.",
