Title: Tight Kitchen, Faster Service

Tags: layout, workflow, speed_of_service, prep, bottlenecks

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize small-footprint station maps, reach zones, collision rules, and build paths. Give measurable throughput targets.

Venue Context: Busy 60-seat neighborhood bistro with a tiny back bar and one service well. Peak demand hits pre-theater from 6:15–7:15pm.

Prompt: We’re getting crushed in a 60-minute pre-theater rush. How should we redesign the station map and build path to hit 120 drinks/hour with one primary well and a service printer? Include reach zones, par lists, and a 20-minute stress drill.

Lloyd's Response:

To manage a 60-minute pre-theater rush and aim for 120 drinks/hour in your venue, we'll need to optimize your station for efficiency and minimal movement. Here’s how you can set up your station map and build path:

### Station Map
- **Primary Well Assignment**: Assign one bartender to manage the primary well for service tickets and guest orders. Ensure the bartender is centrally positioned to minimize reach and movement.
- **Service Printer Placement**: Place the service printer within arm’s reach of the bartender to avoid unnecessary steps. Ideally, this should be in the A zone (0-18").

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0-18")**: Place frequently used bottles, jiggers, and small tools directly in front of the bartender. The ice bin and dump sink should also be in this zone for quick access.
- **Zone B (18-30")**: Store less frequently used ingredients and backup tools. Ensure that these items are still within a quick pivot reach.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Reserve for items that are rarely used during the rush, such as specialty glassware or backup stock.

### Rail Loadout (L→R)
- Organize from left to right by frequency of use: main spirits, modifiers, and then liqueurs.
- Use speed rails for the most popular spirits to reduce reach time.

### Build Path
1. **Glassware Retrieval**: Store glassware above or directly below the station to start each build quickly.
2. **Ice**: Ice the glass immediately after retrieval.
3. **Spirit/Modifier Additions**: Sequence spirits and modifiers in a straight line to minimize crossover.
4. **Shake/Stir**: Use a single shaking/stirring station to streamline the process.
5. **Strain/Garnish**: Ensure garnishes are pre-prepped and stored in reach zones A or B.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Calculate based on your busiest hour—e.g., 120 drinks/hour means prepping enough citrus, syrups, and ice for that volume.
- **Restock Cadence**: Set up restock every 30 minutes during rush to ensure no downtime.
- **Label Scheme**: Use clear, color-coded labels for quick identification of syrups and juices.

### 20-Minute Stress Drill
1. **Mock Rush Setup**: Prepare the station as if for a peak rush, ensuring all pars are met.
2. **Timed Drill**: Run a 20-minute simulation with a goal of 40 drinks (2/3 of peak hour volume).
3. **Role Assignment**: One bartender on drinks, one on support (glassware, restock).
4. **Track KPIs**: Measure ticket times, steps/drink, and any bottlenecks.
5. **Feedback Loop**: Post-drill, review performance, adjust layout or processes as needed.

By optimizing your layout and flow as described, you can meet the demand of 120 drinks/hour with minimal collisions and maximum efficiency.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Staffing Plan:** Include recommendations for the number of bartenders and support staff needed during the rush to ensure efficiency.
  - **Training Protocols:** Outline a training plan for bartenders to familiarize them with the new setup and procedures.
  - **Contingency Plan:** Address potential issues such as equipment failure or unexpected demand spikes.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Overly Detailed Zones:** Simplify the reach zone descriptions to focus on practical, actionable steps rather than precise measurements that may not be applicable to all venues.
  - **Excessive Steps in Build Path:** Streamline the build path to focus on critical actions, avoiding unnecessary details that could overwhelm staff.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a real-time inventory tracking system to monitor stock levels and reduce restock frequency.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a continuous feedback loop with staff to refine processes based on real-time observations and suggestions.
  - **Technology Integration:** Consider using POS systems that integrate with inventory and order management to reduce manual errors and improve speed.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference during busy periods.
  - **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language to ensure instructions are easily understood by all staff members.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Begin each bullet with a verb to emphasize action and implementation (e.g., "Assign," "Place," "Store").
