  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas for compliance and operational readiness. It provides actionable steps and is mostly clear, though it could benefit from more specific guidance on sanitation standards and insurance details. The inclusion of risk assessment and technology integration would enhance feasibility. The tone is appropriate, but more concise bullet points could improve readability. Overall, it aligns well with the client's needs but could incorporate additional recommendations for a more comprehensive approach.",
