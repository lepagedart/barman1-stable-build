  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a structured approach to optimizing bar service under limited power supply, but lacks specific venue context and customer experience considerations. The suggestions are generally feasible but may not be applicable to all venues, particularly the recommendation for portable battery packs. The response could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization of actions. Additionally, incorporating empathy and staff engagement would enhance alignment with venue needs.",
