  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a winter-themed cocktail menu. It includes specific recipes, batching strategies, and operational notes, which are actionable and feasible. However, it lacks venue context and target audience details, which are crucial for tailoring the menu. The response could benefit from further simplification and consideration of flavor degradation in batching. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
