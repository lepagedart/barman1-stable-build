  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a corporate holiday event. The menu design, batching strategy, and staffing flow are feasible and actionable. However, the response could benefit from addressing guest preferences and dietary restrictions. The suggestion to reduce the number of cocktail options and improve staff allocation is valid. The tone is mostly consistent, but operational notes could be more direct. Overall, the response aligns well with the event's goals but could be slightly more concise and focused on critical tasks.",
