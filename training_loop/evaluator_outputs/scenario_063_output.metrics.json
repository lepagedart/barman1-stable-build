  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a structured approach to optimizing bar service under limited power supply, but lacks specific contextualization for the venue type and customer preferences. The recommendations are generally feasible, though suggesting investments like battery packs may not align with all venue budgets. The structure is clear but could benefit from prioritizing quick wins. The action checklist is actionable but could be more concise. Overall, the response aligns with the prompt but could be improved with more tailored advice and a more empathetic tone.",
