  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a range of strategies to reduce costs and waste in a cocktail program, but lacks clarity in prioritizing actions and assessing feasibility for different venues. The response could benefit from clearer action steps and consideration of the venue's capabilities. The suggestions are generally aligned with cost-saving and quality maintenance goals, but could be improved by addressing environmental impact and customer feedback mechanisms.",
