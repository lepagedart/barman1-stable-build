Title: Limited Prep Time Before Large Banquet

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, prep_efficiency, workflow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize fast prep, smart batching, and event-day logistics. Skip long-term program design.

Venue Context: Hotel bar staff have only 2 hours to prep before a 200-person banquet with a limited drink menu.

Prompt: We’ve only got 2 hours to set up for a 200-person banquet. How do we prioritize batching and prep so we can execute cleanly with minimal staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently prepare for a 200-person banquet with limited setup time and staff, prioritize batching and streamlined prep. Here's a focused plan:

### Batching Strategy

1. **Identify High-Volume Cocktails**:
   - Choose 2-3 cocktails that can be pre-batched and are popular for your audience. Consider classics like a Negroni, Margarita, or a simple Highball variant.

2. **Batch the Base Spirits**:
   - Mix the base spirits for each cocktail in large format containers. This reduces individual measuring during service.
   - Example: For a Negroni, batch gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth in equal parts.

3. **Simplified Modifiers**:
   - Pre-dilute with water if the cocktail requires stirring or shaking. This ensures consistency and speed.

### Prep Essentials

1. **Garnishes**:
   - Pre-slice or prepare all necessary garnishes such as lime wheels, lemon twists, or orange slices. Store them in labeled containers for easy access.

2. **Ice Management**:
   - Ensure ice is easily accessible and pre-portioned if possible. Consider placing ice bins at multiple stations to avoid bottlenecks.

3. **Service Setup**:
   - Arrange stations with all necessary tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) and ensure a clear path for service flow.

### Execution Focus

- **Staff Roles**: Assign specific tasks to each staff member, such as pouring, garnishing, or serving, to maximize efficiency.
- **Station Layout**: Set up stations with a logical flow to minimize movement (e.g., batch bottle → ice → glass → garnish).
- **Quick Training**: Brief staff on the cocktail recipes, batching process, and service flow to ensure everyone is aligned.

### Action Checklist

- [ ] Batch base spirits and mixers in labeled containers.
- [ ] Pre-slice and organize garnishes.
- [ ] Set up ice stations and service flow path.
- [ ] Assign specific roles to staff and conduct a quick briefing.
- [ ] Conduct a 10-minute mock service to test the flow.

By focusing on these key areas, you'll be able to execute the banquet service efficiently and effectively, even with minimal staff.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Preferences**: Include a step to assess guest preferences or dietary restrictions to ensure cocktail selection aligns with audience tastes.
  - **Non-Alcoholic Options**: Mention the inclusion of non-alcoholic beverages to cater to all guests.
  - **Contingency Plan**: Outline a backup plan for unexpected issues, such as running out of ingredients or equipment failure.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Complex Cocktails**: Avoid suggesting cocktails that require complex preparation or rare ingredients, which may not be feasible with limited staff.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Check**: Implement a pre-event inventory check to ensure all ingredients and tools are available and in sufficient quantity.
  - **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use a system to monitor consumption rates during the event to adjust batching and service as needed.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a post-event review process to gather staff feedback and identify areas for improvement.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use bullet points for each step to enhance readability and ensure quick reference during preparation.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly direct actions (e.g., "Ensure," "Assign," "Conduct").
  - **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure in listing steps (e.g., start each with a verb, use parallel construction).

- **Conciseness**:
  - **Remove Redundancies**: Eliminate repetitive phrases and focus on essential actions to streamline the guidance.
  - **Prioritize Key Steps**: Highlight the most critical actions to prevent overwhelming staff with too much information.
