  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers essential compliance steps for launching a patio bar. It is clear and actionable, with a focus on licensing, signage, staff training, and batching rules. The shift-opening checklist is practical. However, it could benefit from addressing weather contingencies, noise ordinances, and capacity management. Simplifying batching guidelines and incorporating digital solutions for compliance tracking and inventory management would enhance feasibility. The tone is mostly concise, but further prioritization of steps could improve clarity and alignment with venue needs.",
