  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear strategy for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. It covers key areas such as culinary alignment, ingredient streamlining, and efficient operations. The implementation checklist is actionable and aligns with the overall goal. However, it could benefit from addressing guest feedback, cost analysis, and marketing integration, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Additionally, the response should consider potential challenges with ingredient availability and the suitability of culinary techniques for cocktails. Overall, it's a strong response with room for minor improvements.",
