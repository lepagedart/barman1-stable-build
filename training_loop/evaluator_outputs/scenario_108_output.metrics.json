  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a seasonal menu refresh. It includes actionable steps for menu design, batching, and staff training. However, it lacks specific venue context and customer preference insights, which are crucial for tailoring the menu effectively. The response could benefit from more precise language and a stronger emphasis on staff engagement and motivation.",
