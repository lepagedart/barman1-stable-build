  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for integrating Breakthru's portfolio into a cocktail program. The response is clear and actionable, with specific strategies for financial impact, supplier integration, operational processes, staff training, and guest perception. However, it could benefit from more detailed examples and a clearer understanding of the venue context to ensure alignment with the venue's brand identity and operational capacity. The suggestions in 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' are valid and would enhance the response by providing more tailored and practical guidance.",
