System Mod: Sustainability Lens

Venue Context: A mid-size hotel is moving to eliminate single-use plastic straws but is worried about guest complaints.

Prompt: How should we structure a straw policy that balances sustainability goals with guest expectations and accessibility needs?

Lloyd's Response:

To craft a straw policy that aligns sustainability goals with guest expectations and accessibility needs, follow these steps:

### Policy Structure

1. **Default No-Straw Policy**
   - Implement a default policy of not automatically providing straws with drinks. Train staff to offer straws only upon request to minimize usage.

2. **Sustainable Straw Options**
   - Stock sustainable alternatives such as paper, metal, or biodegradable straws. Ensure that these options are easily accessible for staff when requested by guests.

3. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - Maintain a supply of plastic straws for guests with accessibility needs. Clearly communicate this option to guests and staff to ensure that those who require them can access them easily.

4. **Guest Communication**
   - Use signage and menu notes to inform guests of your sustainability initiative and straw policy. Highlight that straws are available upon request and that options exist for those with specific needs.

5. **Staff Training**
   - Train staff to understand the policy, including the importance of sustainability and the need for accessibility. Equip them with scripts to explain the policy to guests politely and informatively.

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Remove straws from default setups and provide only upon request.
- [ ] Stock a mix of paper, metal, and biodegradable straws for regular use.
- [ ] Keep plastic straws discreetly available for accessibility needs.
- [ ] Create and display signage explaining the straw policy.
- [ ] Train staff on policy details, guest communication, and accessibility support.

By structuring your straw policy in this way, you align with sustainability goals while respecting all guests' needs, ensuring an inclusive and environmentally conscious service experience.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context:** Clearly define the type of venue (e.g., casual dining, fine dining, bar) to tailor the straw policy appropriately.
  - **Guest Demographics:** Consider the specific needs and preferences of the venue's typical clientele to ensure the policy is relevant and effective.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a system for collecting guest feedback on the straw policy to make data-driven adjustments.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumption of Guest Preferences:** Avoid assuming all guests will be receptive to the policy without evidence. Introduce a pilot phase to gauge reactions.
  - **Complexity in Options:** Offering too many straw options may complicate operations. Start with one sustainable alternative and expand based on demand.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a tracking system to monitor straw usage and adjust orders to prevent overstocking or shortages.
  - **Staff Incentives:** Consider incentives for staff who effectively implement the policy and contribute to sustainability goals.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for clarity and brevity in policy communication.
  - **Empathy:** Ensure language reflects understanding and respect for diverse guest needs, particularly in accessibility contexts.
  - **Consistency:** Maintain a consistent tone across all communication materials, from signage to staff scripts, to reinforce the policy's importance.

- **Conciseness:**
  - **Streamline Communication:** Reduce redundancy in policy explanation; focus on key points to maintain guest and staff engagement.
