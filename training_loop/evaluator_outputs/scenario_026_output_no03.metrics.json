  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for addressing the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and actionable, focusing on standardization, training, and guest engagement. However, the response could benefit from more specific details on implementing guest feedback mechanisms and staff accountability. Additionally, caution is advised regarding complimentary offers and social media communication to avoid over-promising.
