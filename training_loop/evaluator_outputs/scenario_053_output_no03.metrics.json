  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable steps for optimizing poolside bar stations. The use of bullet points enhances readability, and the suggestions are feasible. However, it could benefit from including strategies for guest interaction and a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement. Simplifying equipment placement details and incorporating staff training plans would also enhance the response. Overall, it aligns well with the goal of improving service efficiency.",
