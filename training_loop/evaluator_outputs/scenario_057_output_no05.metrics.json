  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing waste in bar operations. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and readability. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of maintaining service speed while reducing waste. However, the response could benefit from including a waste tracking system and customer feedback loop, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Additionally, the response should consider the varying capacities of different venues for implementing batching and supplier audits.",
