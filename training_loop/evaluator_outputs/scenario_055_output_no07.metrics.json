  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for waste reduction in a bar setting. The suggestions are clear and feasible, though the inclusion of data-driven insights and technology integration could enhance the response. The feedback section offers constructive improvements, but the initial response is already strong and client-ready.",
