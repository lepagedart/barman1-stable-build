  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a creative cocktail idea with detailed preparation steps and cost considerations. However, it lacks specific venue context and guest interaction strategies, which are crucial for alignment. The smoke presentation might be challenging in a small space, and more practical alternatives could be suggested. The response could benefit from more concise language and professional terminology. Additionally, addressing potential allergens and providing detailed batching protocols would enhance feasibility and actionability.",
