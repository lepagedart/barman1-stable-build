  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key compliance areas for a mobile bar service. It provides clear steps and an action checklist, making it actionable. However, it could benefit from more specific venue context and local regulation details. The suggestion to avoid specific insurance advice is valid. The response is concise but could use more direct language and prioritization of critical areas.",
