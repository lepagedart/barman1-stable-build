  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers essential compliance steps for launching a patio bar. The use of headings and bullet points aids clarity and readability. The feasibility of the steps is reasonable, though some simplification in batching guidelines could enhance practicality. The response aligns well with the prompt, but could benefit from addressing additional considerations like weather and noise management. Overall, it's a strong, actionable plan with room for minor improvements.",
