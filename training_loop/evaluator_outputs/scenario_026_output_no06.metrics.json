  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a feasible plan for addressing the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The clarity is good, though it could be slightly more concise. The action steps are clear and actionable, and the alignment with the goal of regaining guest trust is strong. However, the response could benefit from a more concise summary and a slightly more empathetic tone.",
