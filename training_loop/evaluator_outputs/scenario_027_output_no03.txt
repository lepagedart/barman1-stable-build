Title: Limited Prep Time Before Large Banquet

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, prep_efficiency, workflow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize fast prep, smart batching, and event-day logistics. Skip long-term program design.

Venue Context: Hotel bar staff have only 2 hours to prep before a 200-person banquet with a limited drink menu.

Prompt: We’ve only got 2 hours to set up for a 200-person banquet. How do we prioritize batching and prep so we can execute cleanly with minimal staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently prepare for a 200-person banquet with limited setup time and staff, prioritize batching and streamlined prep. Here's a focused plan:

### Batching Strategy

1. **Identify High-Volume Cocktails**:
   - Choose 2-3 cocktails that can be pre-batched and are popular for your audience. Consider classics like a Negroni, Margarita, or a simple Highball variant.

2. **Batch the Base Spirits**:
   - Mix the base spirits for each cocktail in large format containers. This reduces individual measuring during service.
   - Example: For a Negroni, batch gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth in equal parts.

3. **Simplified Modifiers**:
   - Pre-dilute with water if the cocktail requires stirring or shaking. This ensures consistency and speed.

### Prep Essentials

1. **Garnishes**:
   - Pre-slice or prepare all necessary garnishes such as lime wheels, lemon twists, or orange slices. Store them in labeled containers for easy access.

2. **Ice Management**:
   - Ensure ice is easily accessible and pre-portioned if possible. Consider placing ice bins at multiple stations to avoid bottlenecks.

3. **Service Setup**:
   - Arrange stations with all necessary tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) and ensure a clear path for service flow.

### Execution Focus

- **Staff Roles**: Assign specific tasks to each staff member, such as pouring, garnishing, or serving, to maximize efficiency.
- **Station Layout**: Set up stations with a logical flow to minimize movement (e.g., batch bottle → ice → glass → garnish).
- **Quick Training**: Brief staff on the cocktail recipes, batching process, and service flow to ensure everyone is aligned.

### Action Checklist

- [ ] Batch base spirits and mixers in labeled containers.
- [ ] Pre-slice and organize garnishes.
- [ ] Set up ice stations and service flow path.
- [ ] Assign specific roles to staff and conduct a quick briefing.
- [ ] Conduct a 10-minute mock service to test the flow.

By focusing on these key areas, you'll be able to execute the banquet service efficiently and effectively, even with minimal staff.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Preferences**: Include a brief survey or historical data analysis to understand guest preferences for cocktails, ensuring the chosen drinks align with their tastes.
  - **Non-Alcoholic Options**: Mention the inclusion of non-alcoholic beverages to cater to all guests.
  - **Allergy and Dietary Considerations**: Address potential allergens in cocktails and provide alternatives or clear labeling.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Pre-Dilution Assumption**: Avoid assuming pre-dilution is universally applicable; some cocktails may suffer in quality. Specify which cocktails are suitable for this method.
  - **Mock Service**: Suggest a more comprehensive rehearsal if time allows, rather than a brief 10-minute mock service, to better identify potential issues.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a checklist system for inventory tracking to ensure all ingredients and tools are accounted for before the event.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a post-event review process to gather feedback from staff and guests for continuous improvement.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Precision**: Use bullet points consistently for all sections to enhance readability and ensure key actions are easily identifiable.
  - **Actionable Language**: Use imperative verbs (e.g., "Ensure," "Prepare," "Assign") to convey clear, direct instructions.
  - **Consistency**: Maintain a consistent structure across all sections, such as starting each with a brief objective or goal statement.
