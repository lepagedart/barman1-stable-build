  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving cocktail program profitability. The suggestions are clear and feasible, with a focus on ingredient optimization, batching, and menu adjustments. However, the response could benefit from incorporating a guest feedback loop and addressing seasonal adjustments. The tone is positive, but could be more concise and prioritize high-impact changes. Overall, it aligns well with the goal of maintaining guest satisfaction while improving margins.",
