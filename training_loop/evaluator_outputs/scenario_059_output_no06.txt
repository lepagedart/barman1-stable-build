Lloyd's Response:

To align your cocktail list with Breakthru’s portfolio targets while maintaining a premium guest experience, you should focus on strategic placements, operational guardrails, and value tracking. Here’s a concise plan to achieve this:

### Financial Impact
- **Pour Cost Targets**: Set a target pour cost percentage for Breakthru products, ideally between 18-22% to ensure profitability while meeting portfolio goals.
- **SKU Rationalization**: Focus on a core selection of Breakthru’s best-selling or most promoted spirits. Limit unique SKUs to avoid overstock and simplify inventory management.
- **Incentive Tracking**: Establish a quarterly review process with Breakthru to assess incentives and adjust placements based on performance.

### Supplier Integration
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Schedule regular meetings with Breakthru representatives to discuss performance metrics, explore new product launches, and align on promotional strategies.
- **Menu Adaptations**: Be prepared to adjust the cocktail list in response to incentive changes, ensuring that new placements align with both guest expectations and financial goals.

### Operational Processes
- **SKU Mapping**: Clearly map Breakthru products to their corresponding cocktails, ensuring staff can easily identify and upsell these items.
- **Par Level Management**: Maintain optimal stock levels for Breakthru products to prevent outages and over-purchasing.

### Staff Training

- **Upselling Scripts**: Provide staff with scripts and techniques for effectively recommending Breakthru-based cocktails.

### Guest Perception
- **Premium Feel**: Ensure that the use of Breakthru products does not come off as a sales push. Highlight quality and craftsmanship in cocktail descriptions and presentations.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use guest feedback to refine the menu and service approach, ensuring that portfolio-driven choices remain guest-centric.
