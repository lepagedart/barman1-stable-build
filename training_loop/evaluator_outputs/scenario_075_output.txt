Tags: event_setup, layout, speed_of_service, staffing, throughput

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Combine event setup + layout lenses: quick-serve stations, glassware flow, ice/mixer totals, and contingency plans.

Venue Context: Hotel courtyard pop-up for a summer launch event. Expect 350 guests in 90 minutes; two bars plus one roving tray team.

Prompt: Design a pop-up service to move 350 guests through Champagne and two spritz SKUs in 90 minutes. Provide station maps, staffing roles, par levels, ice/mixer math, tray runs, and a 20-minute peak drill. Keep lines under 4 minutes.

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently serve 350 guests with Champagne and two spritz cocktails in 90 minutes, a well-organized pop-up service plan is crucial. Here's a detailed strategy to keep lines moving and ensure a premium guest experience.

### Station Setup
- **Bar Layout**: Two main service bars, each 6-feet long, positioned centrally to the guest flow.
- **Station Map**:
  ```
  | Ice Bin | Champagne | Spritz 1 | Spritz 2 | Garnishes | POS |
  ```

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartenders (4 total)**:
  - **2 Champagne Pourers**: Dedicated to quickly popping bottles and pouring Champagne.
  - **2 Spritz Makers**: Focused on mixing and serving the two spritz cocktails.
- **1 Runner**: Handles restocking of Champagne, mixers, and ice; assists with tray runs.
- **1 Support Staff**: Manages glassware collection and cleaning.

### Par Levels and Inventory
- **Champagne**: Estimate 1.5 glasses per guest. For 350 guests, prepare 525 glasses. Depending on bottle size, calculate total bottles needed (e.g., approximately 105 bottles for 750ml size).
- **Spritz Ingredients**: 
  - **Spritz 1 & 2**: Pre-batch each spritz for easy pouring. Mix enough for roughly 1 drink per person per SKU.
  - **Garnishes**: Lemon wheels, orange slices, or herbs depending on the spritz recipes.
- **Ice**: Calculate based on spritz needs, approximately 1 pound per drink plus reserves.
- **Mixers**: Batches should include any soda or tonic needed for spritzes.

### Ice and Mixer Math
- **Ice**: Ensure a minimum of 350 pounds of ice, with an additional 100 pounds reserve.
- **Mixer**: Confirm quantities align with recipe batching, allowing for slight over-prep to prevent shortages.

### Tray Runs
- **Trays**: Use for circulating Champagne and spritzes during peak times. Each tray holds 8-10 drinks.
- **Runner Tasks**: Refill trays every 5 minutes; coordinate with bartenders to ensure constant availability.

### 20-Minute Peak Drill
1. **Pre-Shift Huddle**: Brief staff on roles and expectations. Emphasize speed and efficiency.
2. **Mock Service**: Conduct a 20-minute drill with staff serving each other to simulate peak conditions.
3. **Review & Adjust**: Post-drill, discuss bottlenecks and adjust station setups accordingly.
4. **Final Prep**: Confirm all stations are restocked and ready.
5. **Go Live**: Start service with all stations fully operational and staffed.

### Contingency Plans
- **Glassware**: Keep extra stock available; assign a staff member to monitor and replenish.
- **Ice/Power Issues**: Have backup ice stored in coolers; use manual methods if electrical equipment fails.
- **Staffing**: Cross-train staff to cover roles in case of absenteeism.

This plan should keep lines moving efficiently and ensure guests enjoy their drinks with minimal wait times.

### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Guest Flow Management:** Include a plan for managing guest flow to and from the bars to prevent congestion.
  - **Signage:** Ensure clear signage for drink options and bar locations to guide guests efficiently.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for real-time feedback from staff and guests during the event to address issues promptly.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Detailed Inventory Calculations:** Simplify inventory calculations to focus on essentials, avoiding overly complex estimations that may not be necessary for the event's scale.
  - **Mock Service Drill:** While beneficial, a full 20-minute drill may be excessive. Opt for a shorter, focused rehearsal to save time.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Digital POS System:** Utilize a digital POS system to streamline transactions and track inventory in real-time.
  - **Pre-Event Checklist:** Develop a comprehensive checklist to ensure all elements are prepared and accounted for before the event begins.
  - **Staff Communication Tools:** Equip staff with communication tools (e.g., radios or apps) for efficient coordination during the event.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each section is easy to digest.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Focus on direct, actionable language to guide staff clearly on their tasks.
  - **Prioritization:** Highlight critical tasks and contingencies to ensure they receive appropriate attention and resources.
