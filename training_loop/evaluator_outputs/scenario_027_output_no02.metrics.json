  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for efficiently managing a banquet with limited resources. The batching strategy and prep essentials are practical and feasible. However, the response could improve by addressing guest preferences, non-alcoholic options, and glassware management. The suggestion for a mock service might be impractical with limited time, and pre-dilution guidance should consider taste impact. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could benefit from slight adjustments for completeness and practicality.",
