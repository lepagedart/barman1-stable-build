Title: Improving Speed of Service at High-Volume Concert Venue

Tags: workflow, layout_flow, event_setup, speed_of_service

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Recommend ergonomic layouts, batching, and staffing strategies specific to live events.

Venue Context: Concert hall with 1,500 guests and multiple lobby bars. Guests often miss music sets waiting in long lines for drinks.

Prompt: During concerts, lines for drinks are insane and guests miss the show. How should we design bar setups and menus to maximize speed without sacrificing margins?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your bar setup and menu for speed during concerts, focus on streamlining service while maintaining profitability. Here are actionable recommendations:

**Bar Setup and Ergonomics**

1. **Station Map**:
   - Designate separate Service and Guest Wells to handle different volume needs.
   - Create clear traffic lanes for staff movement, minimizing collisions.

2. **Reach Zones**:
   - Zone A (0–18"): Essential tools, commonly used spirits, and glassware.
   - Zone B (18–30"): Secondary spirits and mixers.
   - Zone C (>30"): Reserve storage for less frequently used items.

3. **Rail Loadout**:
   - Arrange bottles from left to right based on frequency of use.
   - Position jiggers and tools centrally for quick access.
   - Ensure dump sinks and ice wells are conveniently located.

4. **Build Path**:
   - Standardize a FIFO process: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.

5. **Collision Controls**:
   - Implement one-way traffic lanes.
   - Position POS systems strategically to avoid bottlenecks.
   - Define "no stand" zones to keep pathways clear.

**Menu Adjustments for Speed**

1. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch high-demand cocktails to minimize individual drink assembly time.
   - Use liquor-only batching for extended shelf life, and ensure freshness with daily prep.

2. **Simplified Offerings**:
   - Focus on a concise menu with high-margin, easy-to-prepare cocktails.
   - Limit bespoke ingredients to reduce complexity and speed up service.

3. **Draft Cocktails**:
   - Consider offering a few high-volume cocktails on draft to expedite service.
   - This requires upfront investment but significantly reduces serve time.

4. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - Maintain margins by ensuring all cocktails have a similar pour cost percentage.
   - Regularly review and adjust pricing based on ingredient costs and sales data.

**Operational Checklist**

- Set up a 5-step action checklist for staff training on the new setup.
- Run a 20-minute mock service drill to test the efficiency of the new layout.
- Schedule quarterly reviews to assess margins and service speed.
- Implement a restock cadence to maintain par levels without disrupting service.

Using these strategies, you can enhance service speed during concerts, ensuring guests spend less time in line and more time enjoying the show, without compromising your margins.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include specific examples or case studies of successful bar setups during high-volume events to provide context and credibility.
  - Address potential challenges or resistance from staff when implementing new systems and how to overcome them.
  - Provide a timeline for implementation, including short-term and long-term goals.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid assuming that all venues can afford upfront investments like draft cocktail systems; suggest scalable solutions for different budget levels.
  - Be cautious with recommending extensive menu changes without considering the venue's brand or customer preferences.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Introduce a feedback loop for staff to report on the effectiveness of the new setup and suggest improvements.
  - Develop a phased rollout plan for new processes to minimize disruption during peak times.
  - Recommend a digital inventory management system to streamline restocking and reduce waste.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more structured format with numbered sections for clarity and ease of reference.
  - Maintain a professional yet approachable tone, avoiding overly technical jargon that might alienate non-expert readers.
  - Begin with a brief executive summary highlighting the key benefits of the proposed changes to capture attention immediately.
