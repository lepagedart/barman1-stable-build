  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for efficiently managing a banquet with limited resources. The use of batching and streamlined prep is feasible and actionable. However, it could benefit from addressing guest preferences, non-alcoholic options, and a contingency plan. The structure is mostly clear, but could be improved with more consistent use of bullet points and imperative language. Overall, it aligns well with the task but could be slightly more concise and comprehensive.",
