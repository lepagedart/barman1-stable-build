  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for optimizing a nightclub's bar layout. The approach is feasible and actionable, with clear steps and considerations for ergonomics and efficiency. However, the clarity could be improved by using more concise bullet points and prioritizing actions. The alignment with the scenario is strong, but the response could benefit from addressing staff training and feedback mechanisms more explicitly.",
