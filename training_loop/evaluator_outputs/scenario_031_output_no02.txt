Title: Speed-Well Redesign for Two-Bartender Service

Tags: layout_flow, prep_efficiency, speed, service_well, menu_design

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize station ergonomics, rail loadout, reach zones, and build-path sequencing. Include a 15-minute peak stress drill with throughput targets.

Venue Context: 80-seat neighborhood restaurant; bar has 10 stools and a single service well. Friday/Saturday peaks with two bartenders on, one focused on service well tickets.

Prompt: Our service well gets crushed on weekends. Can you redesign the well layout and build flow so two bartenders can run without collisions and keep ticket times under five minutes?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your service well for efficient operation with two bartenders during peak times, focus on minimizing movement, preventing collisions, and ensuring a streamlined build flow. Here's a practical approach:

### Station Map
- **Role Designation**: Assign one bartender to the service well for server tickets and the other to the guest-facing well to handle direct customers. This separation helps reduce the need for crossover and potential collisions.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Implement a one-way flow behind the bar to avoid collisions. Depending on your layout, choose a left-to-right or right-to-left movement pattern. Mark lanes with floor tape if needed for clarity.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Keep frequently used items like jiggers, strainers, and bitters within immediate reach.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Place less frequently used bottles and tools here. This zone is ideal for spirits used in multiple cocktails.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Store backup supplies and less-used bottles outside of immediate reach to avoid clutter.

### Rail Loadout
- **Bottle Order**: Arrange bottles from left to right based on usage frequency and type. Consider grouping similar categories together (e.g., vodka, gin, rum).
- **Tool Placement**: Position jiggers, shakers, and strainers in a central location within Zone A for easy access.

### Build Path
- **Sequence**: Follow a consistent build order: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.
- **Efficiency**: Use a two-bottle pour technique where possible to save time on builds.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set clear pars for ice, citrus, and syrups. Ensure these are prepped and restocked during slower periods.
- **Labeling**: Use clear labels for syrups and juices to prevent confusion and speed up service.

### Collision Controls
- **POS Placement**: Ensure the POS system is easily accessible without crossing paths. Consider a second terminal if space allows.
- **Pass Line**: Establish a designated pass line for drinks to be picked up by servers, reducing the need for bartenders to move around.

### KPIs & Stress Test
- **Throughput Target**: Aim for 12–15 tickets per minute during peak times.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 15-minute drill before peak hours to identify bottlenecks and adjust as needed.

### Summary Checklist
1. Assign and clarify bartender roles.
2. Mark traffic lanes and ensure one-way movement.
3. Set up reach zones and rail loadout for optimal efficiency.
4. Establish a consistent build path and train staff on it.
5. Conduct a pre-service drill to test and refine the setup.

Implementing these changes should help streamline your service well operations, reduce collisions, and keep ticket times under five minutes.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include specific examples or case studies to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies.
  - Address potential challenges or resistance from staff when implementing new systems.
  - Provide guidance on how to monitor and adjust the system post-implementation for continuous improvement.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid setting overly ambitious throughput targets (e.g., 12–15 tickets per minute) without considering venue-specific constraints and staff capabilities.
  - Ensure that the proposed solutions are scalable and adaptable to different bar layouts and sizes.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Introduce a feedback loop where bartenders can report inefficiencies or suggest improvements after shifts.
  - Develop a training module for new staff to quickly adapt to the proposed system.
  - Implement a digital inventory management system to track usage and restocking needs in real-time.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more collaborative tone, inviting input and feedback from the bar staff to foster buy-in.
  - Structure the response with clear headings and subheadings for each section to enhance readability.
  - Begin with a brief introduction summarizing the current challenges and the intended outcomes of the proposed changes.
