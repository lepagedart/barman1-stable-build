Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Contextualization**: 
  - Provide specific examples or case studies of successful waste-reduction implementations in similar venues to ground the advice in real-world application.
  - Include potential challenges or limitations of each strategy to prepare the venue for practical hurdles.

- **Overreach**:
  - Avoid assuming all venues have the same capacity for ingredient storage or pre-prep space. Tailor suggestions to different venue sizes and capabilities.
  - Do not imply that all bartenders have the same skill level; consider varying levels of expertise in training recommendations.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - Suggest a phased implementation plan to test and measure the effectiveness of each strategy before full-scale adoption.
  - Recommend a feedback loop with bartenders to refine processes based on their on-the-ground experience.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - Use a more directive tone, such as "implement" instead of "consider integrating," to convey authority and confidence.
  - Structure the response with clear, numbered steps or phases to guide the venue through a logical progression of implementation.
  - Ensure clarity by defining industry-specific terms or techniques for audiences who may not be familiar with them.
