  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive training plan. It clearly outlines the session's components and includes practical steps. However, it could benefit from more specific goals and addressing potential challenges. The tone is appropriate, but a more conversational style could enhance engagement. Overall, it's a strong, client-ready response with minor improvements needed.",
