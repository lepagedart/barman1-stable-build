  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for leveraging POS and inventory technology. It clearly outlines system integration, accuracy improvement, and forecasting enhancement. However, it could benefit from more specific venue context and staff training considerations. The suggestion for predictive ordering is noted as potentially overreaching without historical data. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed for full alignment with venue-specific needs.",
