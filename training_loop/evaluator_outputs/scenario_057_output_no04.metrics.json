  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing waste in bar operations. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and readability. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of maintaining service speed while reducing waste. However, the response could be improved by including metrics for success, customer engagement strategies, and technology integration. Additionally, prioritizing the strategies by impact or ease of implementation would provide clearer guidance. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor enhancements needed for a more comprehensive approach.",
