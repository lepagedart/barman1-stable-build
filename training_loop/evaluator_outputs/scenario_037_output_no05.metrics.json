  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a corporate event. The menu design, batching strategy, and staffing flow are feasible and actionable. However, it could benefit from addressing guest preferences and dietary restrictions. The feedback and training protocols are good suggestions for improvement. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor enhancements needed.",
