  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and clear, with actionable steps for reducing waste in bar operations. However, it lacks data-driven insights and guest engagement strategies, which are crucial for comprehensive waste reduction. The feasibility of supplier changes and batching assumptions may not apply to all venues, and these should be addressed. The response aligns with the goal of reducing waste but could benefit from more specific metrics and a feedback loop for continuous improvement.",
