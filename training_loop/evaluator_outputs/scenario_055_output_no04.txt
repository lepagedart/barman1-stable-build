Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Contextual Relevance**: Clearly define the venue type and peak hours to tailor strategies specifically to the operational needs and constraints of the establishment.
  
- **Overreach Correction**: Avoid assuming that all venues have the same capacity for ingredient cross-utilization or pre-prep techniques. Tailor suggestions based on venue size and staff experience.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - Implement a tracking system for ingredient usage and waste to identify key areas for improvement.
  - Develop a feedback loop with bartenders to refine and adapt waste-reduction strategies based on real-time challenges and successes.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - Use a more directive tone with actionable steps, e.g., "Start by auditing your current ingredient usage to identify overlap opportunities."
  - Structure the response to prioritize quick wins that can be implemented immediately, followed by longer-term strategies.

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - Include a section on monitoring and measuring the impact of these strategies to ensure they are effective and adjust as necessary.
  - Address potential barriers to implementation, such as staff resistance or lack of resources, and provide solutions to overcome them.
