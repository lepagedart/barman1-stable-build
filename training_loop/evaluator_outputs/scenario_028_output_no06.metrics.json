  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear strategy for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. It aligns with the venue's needs and offers actionable steps. However, it could improve by including guest engagement strategies and sustainability practices. The response assumes certain capabilities that may not be present in all venues, which could affect feasibility. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for enhancement.",
