  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and clear, with actionable steps for optimizing bar operations. However, the feasibility of the throughput target is questionable without more context. The response could benefit from including staff training and feedback mechanisms, as well as addressing customer interaction. Overall, it aligns well with the goal of improving efficiency but could be improved with more realistic targets and comprehensive training suggestions.",
