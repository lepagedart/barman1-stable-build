  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan for preparing a banquet with limited resources. The use of bullet points enhances readability, and the focus on batching and streamlined prep is practical. However, it could benefit from addressing guest preferences and including non-alcoholic options. The suggestion to avoid complex cocktails is valid, and the inclusion of an inventory checklist and feedback loop would strengthen the process. Overall, the response aligns well with the scenario's needs but could be slightly more comprehensive.",
