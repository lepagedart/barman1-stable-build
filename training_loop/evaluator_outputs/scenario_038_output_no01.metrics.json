  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, focusing on batching and simplicity. Clarity could be improved by addressing missing venue context and customer demographics. The structure is mostly clear but could benefit from more concise bullet points. Actionability is strong, though more direct language could enhance it. Alignment with the prompt is good, but additional context would improve it.",
