Title: Speed-Well Redesign for Two-Bartender Service

Tags: layout_flow, prep_efficiency, speed, service_well, menu_design

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize station ergonomics, rail loadout, reach zones, and build-path sequencing. Include a 15-minute peak stress drill with throughput targets.

Venue Context: 80-seat neighborhood restaurant; bar has 10 stools and a single service well. Friday/Saturday peaks with two bartenders on, one focused on service well tickets.

Prompt: Our service well gets crushed on weekends. Can you redesign the well layout and build flow so two bartenders can run without collisions and keep ticket times under five minutes?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your service well layout for two bartenders, we'll focus on minimizing movement, preventing collisions, and ensuring an efficient build flow. Here's a practical approach:

### Station Map
- **Service Well Assignment**: Designate one bartender to primarily handle the service well and the other to focus on the guest-facing well to streamline roles and reduce crossover.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Establish a one-way flow behind the bar to avoid collisions — for example, moving left-to-right or vice versa, depending on your layout.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Place frequently used items like jiggers, strainers, and glassware within easy reach. The speed rail should hold core spirits in the order of the cocktail build.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Store secondary items like juices, syrups, and bitters here. Use speed pourers for quick access.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Reserve for less frequently used items, like extra glassware or backup spirits.

### Rail Loadout
- **Left to Right**: Arrange spirits in the order of most used cocktails — e.g., vodka, gin, rum, tequila, whiskey, liqueurs. Ensure modifiers like vermouths and bitters are grouped nearby.
- **Tools and Dump Sink**: Place tools like muddlers and bar spoons on the far left or right, depending on dominant hand use. Keep the dump sink centrally located but easily accessible.

### Build Path
1. **FIFO Order**: Align the build path from glass to garnish. Start with glassware, add ice, pour spirits, add modifiers, shake/stir, strain, and finish with garnish.
2. **Batching**: Pre-batch popular cocktails or modifiers if volume justifies it to speed up service.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set daily pars for ice, citrus, and syrups to prevent shortages. Label and date all prepped items.
- **Restock Cadence**: Establish a restock routine during lulls (e.g., every hour) to maintain readiness.

### Collision Controls
- **POS Placement**: Ensure the POS system is within reach but doesn’t disrupt flow. Avoid placing it near the busiest stations.
- **Pass Line and No-Stand Zones**: Create designated areas for order handoffs and ensure bartenders avoid lingering in high-traffic zones.

### KPIs & Tests
- **Tickets/Minute**: Aim for at least 2-3 tickets per minute per bartender during peak times.
- **Steps/Drink**: Minimize steps by organizing tools and ingredients logically.
- **Stress Test**: Conduct a 15-minute mock service drill to identify and address bottlenecks.

### 5-Step Action Checklist
1. Reorganize tools and spirits according to the specified rail loadout.
2. Set clear roles for each bartender and establish traffic lanes.
3. Implement batching for high-volume cocktails.
4. Schedule regular restocking and prep check-ins.
5. Conduct a mock service drill to fine-tune layout and build flow.

This layout strategy should help your bartenders work more efficiently, reduce wait times, and handle high-volume service with ease.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context**: Provide specific details about the venue layout and constraints to tailor the advice more precisely.
  - **Customization**: Offer options for different bar sizes or configurations (e.g., U-shaped, L-shaped) to ensure applicability across various setups.
  - **Technology Integration**: Mention potential use of technology (e.g., automated inventory systems) to support the proposed processes.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumptions on Bartender Roles**: Avoid assuming the venue has a strict division of roles without understanding staff capabilities and preferences.
  - **Batching Advice**: Clarify that batching should comply with local regulations and consider the impact on cocktail quality.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Feedback Loop**: Implement a regular feedback mechanism for bartenders to suggest improvements to the layout and processes.
  - **Training Module**: Develop a training module for new staff to quickly adapt to the optimized layout and processes.
  - **Continuous Improvement**: Schedule periodic reviews of the layout and processes to adapt to changing service demands or menu updates.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Clarity**: Ensure each section has a clear, actionable outcome, avoiding overly technical jargon.
  - **Engagement**: Encourage staff involvement by suggesting they participate in the mock service drill and provide feedback.

- **Additional Considerations:**
  - **Safety Protocols**: Include safety protocols to prevent accidents, especially in high-traffic areas.
  - **Sustainability**: Suggest eco-friendly practices, like minimizing waste during batching and restocking.
