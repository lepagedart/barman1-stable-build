  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a solid foundation for leveraging POS and inventory tech but lacks specific contextual details and considerations for varying venue capabilities. The structure is clear but could benefit from more concise bullet points. Actionability is moderate, with room for more direct guidance. Alignment with potential client needs is average, as it doesn't fully address training, vendor selection, or phased implementation strategies.",
