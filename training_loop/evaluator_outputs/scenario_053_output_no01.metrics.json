  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable steps for optimizing poolside bar stations. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the recommendations are feasible. However, the response could benefit from addressing guest experience and staff training more explicitly. The complexity of the setup might overwhelm staff, and simplifying some elements could improve feasibility. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with additional focus on guest engagement and feedback mechanisms.",
