  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, feasible plan for training staff in upselling techniques. The response is mostly clear, though it could benefit from more concise language in some areas. The action steps are practical and align well with the goal of enhancing upselling without being pushy. The addition of a guest-centric approach and feedback loop in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section is valuable, though the initial response already covers most necessary aspects effectively.",
