Prompt: How should we design a cocktail list that is manageable for one bartender, keeps costs under control, and still feels thoughtful for guests?

Lloyd's Response:

To design a cocktail list that's manageable for one bartender, cost-effective, and appealing to guests, focus on simplicity, versatility, and guest experience. Here’s a structured plan:

### Cocktail List Design
1. **Balanced Families**: Include a mix of cocktail families to provide variety. Consider:
   - **Sour**: A classic Margarita or Daiquiri.
   - **Old Fashioned**: A simple Whiskey Old Fashioned.
   - **Highball**: A Gin & Tonic or Vodka Soda.
   - **Martini/Manhattan Variants**: A basic Negroni or Manhattan.

2. **Shared Ingredients**: Use common ingredients across multiple drinks to simplify inventory and reduce costs. For example, citrus, simple syrup, and a versatile spirit like vodka or gin can be used in various cocktails.

3. **Limited SKUs**: Keep the back bar streamlined by limiting unique ingredients. Aim for a core selection of spirits that can be used in multiple drinks.

4. **Seasonal/Local Flavor**: Incorporate a seasonal or local ingredient that can be featured in a special cocktail or as a garnish to add interest without complicating the menu.

### Operational Considerations
- **Batching**: If possible, batch liquor-only components of popular cocktails to speed up service and maintain consistency.
- **Prep Time**: Limit cocktails that require extensive prep or rare ingredients. Focus on builds and simple shakes/stirs.
- **Shelf Life**: Choose components with a good shelf life to minimize waste and cost.

### Menu Presentation
- **Clear Descriptions**: Provide brief but enticing descriptions that highlight the main flavors or unique aspects.
- **Price Range**: Ensure pricing aligns with your cost targets, ideally aiming for a pour cost of around 20-25%.

### Execution Checklist
- **Test Runs**: Conduct a mock service to ensure the bartender can manage the flow smoothly.
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather guest feedback to refine the menu over time.
- **Training**: Ensure the bartender is well-versed in each recipe to maintain quality and speed.

By focusing on these elements, you can create a cocktail list that’s both efficient for the bartender and engaging for guests, all while keeping costs in check.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., upscale bar, casual pub) to tailor the cocktail list to the clientele and setting.
  - **Target Audience**: Identify the target demographic to ensure the cocktail offerings align with their preferences.
  - **Competitive Analysis**: Include a brief comparison with local competitors to ensure the menu stands out.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Complexity**: Avoid suggesting batching without assessing the venue’s storage and prep capabilities. Not all venues can accommodate this.
  - **Ingredient Assumptions**: Do not assume the availability of certain ingredients without confirming with the venue’s supply chain.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a digital inventory system to track ingredient usage and reduce waste.
  - **Regular Updates**: Schedule quarterly reviews of the cocktail list to incorporate seasonal changes and guest feedback.
  - **Training Program**: Develop a structured training program for new bartenders to ensure consistency and quality.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly communicate steps (e.g., "Incorporate," "Limit," "Conduct").
  - **Prioritization**: Highlight the most critical actions at the beginning of each section to guide focus.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can create a more tailored and efficient cocktail program that aligns with the venue’s capabilities and guest expectations.
