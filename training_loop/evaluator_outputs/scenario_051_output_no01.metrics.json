  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible strategies for creating a sustainable fall cocktail menu. It clearly outlines sustainable practices, cost management, and operational efficiency. However, it could benefit from more precise language and actionable steps. The addition of market analysis and feedback mechanisms would enhance alignment with consumer preferences. The structure is mostly consistent, but some sections could be more concise.",
