Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Deliver precise batch math, shelf-life considerations, and storage planning. Emphasize hot/comfort cocktails that hold well in batch form.

Venue Context: Neighborhood restaurant switching to a winter menu. They want to feature mulled drinks and spirit-forward builds while keeping prep lean.

Prompt: Winter is here and our GM wants mulled drinks and batched classics that feel cozy but donâ€™t crush the staff. How do we batch and structure the menu so everything stays profitable and consistent?

Lloyd's Response:

To craft a winter-themed cocktail menu that's both cozy and efficient, here's a plan focusing on batching and simplicity:

### Menu Structure and Strategy

1. **Mulled Wine & Cider**:
   - **Mulled Wine**: Ideal for batching. Use a slow cooker to keep warm.
     - **Spec**: 1 bottle red wine, 1/4 cup brandy, 1/4 cup honey, 4 cloves, 2 cinnamon sticks, 1 orange (sliced).
     - **Service**: Heatproof glasses or mugs, garnish with an orange slice.
     - **Cost Notes**: Opt for a mid-range wine. Target pour cost around 20%.
   - **Mulled Cider**: Non-alcoholic option that can be spiked per order with whiskey or rum.
     - **Spec**: 1 gallon apple cider, 1/4 cup brown sugar, 4 cloves, 3 cinnamon sticks, 1 allspice berry.
     - **Service**: Serve in mugs, optional shot of spirit per order.

2. **Batched Classics**:
   - **Old Fashioned**:
     - **Spec**: 6 parts bourbon, 1 part simple syrup, 1-2 dashes Angostura bitters per serving.
     - **Batching**: Mix whiskey and syrup in advance; bitters added per serve for freshness.
     - **Service**: Rocks glass, large ice cube, orange twist.
     - **Cost Notes**: Use house bourbon for a 15-18% target pour cost.
   - **Negroni**:
     - **Spec**: 1 part gin, 1 part Campari, 1 part sweet vermouth.
     - **Batching**: Pre-mix and store in the fridge.
     - **Service**: Serve over ice in a rocks glass, orange peel garnish.
     - **Cost Notes**: Balanced cost with mid-range spirits.

### Operational Notes

- **Batching**: Focus on liquor-only batches for longer shelf life. Prepare batches weekly as needed based on sales.
- **Station Setup**: Keep mulled drinks in slow cookers near the bar for easy access. Pre-batched cocktails should be chilled and ready to pour.
- **Efficiency**: Limit menu to 3-4 cocktails to reduce complexity and maintain speed.
- **Staff Training**: Ensure all staff are familiar with batched recipes and service steps to maintain consistency.

This approach should streamline service, keep costs in check, and deliver a warm, inviting winter experience for guests.

### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context**: Include specific details about the venue's size, clientele, and existing bar capabilities to tailor the menu effectively.
  - **Customer Preferences**: Incorporate insights on customer preferences or past sales data to ensure the menu aligns with guest expectations.
  - **Allergen Information**: Provide clear allergen information for each drink, especially with spices and garnishes.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Complexity of Batching**: Simplify the batching process by recommending a maximum of two batched cocktails to avoid overburdening staff and storage.
  - **Menu Size**: Consider reducing the menu to two signature cocktails to ensure quality and speed of service.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a tracking system for batched ingredients to minimize waste and ensure freshness.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a process for gathering guest feedback on the new menu to make iterative improvements.
  - **Training Modules**: Develop concise training modules or quick reference guides for staff to ensure consistent execution.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Precision**: Use bullet points for each cocktail to enhance readability and focus on key details.
  - **Actionable Steps**: Provide step-by-step instructions for each process, such as batching and service, to ensure clarity.
  - **Professional Tone**: Maintain a professional and concise tone throughout, avoiding overly casual language to ensure the guidance is taken seriously.
