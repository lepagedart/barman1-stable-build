Title: Improving Speed of Service at High-Volume Concert Venue

Tags: workflow, layout_flow, event_setup, speed_of_service

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Recommend ergonomic layouts, batching, and staffing strategies specific to live events.

Venue Context: Concert hall with 1,500 guests and multiple lobby bars. Guests often miss music sets waiting in long lines for drinks.

Prompt: During concerts, lines for drinks are insane and guests miss the show. How should we design bar setups and menus to maximize speed without sacrificing margins?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your bar setup and menu for speed during concerts, focus on streamlining service while maintaining profitability. Here are actionable recommendations:

**Bar Setup and Ergonomics**

1. **Station Map**:
   - Designate separate Service and Guest Wells to handle different volume needs.
   - Create clear traffic lanes for staff movement, minimizing collisions.

2. **Reach Zones**:
   - Zone A (0–18"): Essential tools, commonly used spirits, and glassware.
   - Zone B (18–30"): Secondary spirits and mixers.
   - Zone C (>30"): Reserve storage for less frequently used items.

3. **Rail Loadout**:
   - Arrange bottles from left to right based on frequency of use.
   - Position jiggers and tools centrally for quick access.
   - Ensure dump sinks and ice wells are conveniently located.

4. **Build Path**:
   - Standardize a FIFO process: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.

5. **Collision Controls**:
   - Implement one-way traffic lanes.
   - Position POS systems strategically to avoid bottlenecks.
   - Define "no stand" zones to keep pathways clear.

**Menu Adjustments for Speed**

1. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch high-demand cocktails to minimize individual drink assembly time.
   - Use liquor-only batching for extended shelf life, and ensure freshness with daily prep.

2. **Simplified Offerings**:
   - Focus on a concise menu with high-margin, easy-to-prepare cocktails.
   - Limit bespoke ingredients to reduce complexity and speed up service.

3. **Draft Cocktails**:
   - Consider offering a few high-volume cocktails on draft to expedite service.
   - This requires upfront investment but significantly reduces serve time.

4. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - Maintain margins by ensuring all cocktails have a similar pour cost percentage.
   - Regularly review and adjust pricing based on ingredient costs and sales data.

**Operational Checklist**

- Set up a 5-step action checklist for staff training on the new setup.
- Run a 20-minute mock service drill to test the efficiency of the new layout.
- Schedule quarterly reviews to assess margins and service speed.
- Implement a restock cadence to maintain par levels without disrupting service.

Using these strategies, you can enhance service speed during concerts, ensuring guests spend less time in line and more time enjoying the show, without compromising your margins.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Data-Driven Insights**: Include metrics or data to support the proposed changes, such as expected time savings or increased throughput.
  - **Staff Feedback Loop**: Incorporate a mechanism for staff to provide feedback on the new setup and menu changes to ensure continuous improvement.
  - **Customer Experience Consideration**: Address how these changes will impact customer satisfaction and experience beyond speed, such as quality and consistency.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Draft Cocktails Investment**: Acknowledge the financial implications and provide a cost-benefit analysis to justify the draft cocktail system.
  - **Standardization vs. Flexibility**: Balance the need for standardization with the flexibility to adapt to different event types or unexpected changes in demand.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Technology Integration**: Suggest using technology like inventory management systems to automate restock alerts and streamline operations.
  - **Training Program**: Develop a comprehensive training program that includes not only the new processes but also customer service skills to enhance overall guest experience.
  - **Performance Metrics**: Establish KPIs to measure the success of the new setup and menu adjustments, such as average service time per drink or customer satisfaction scores.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Precision**: Use clear, concise language with specific, actionable steps. Avoid jargon that may not be understood by all staff members.
  - **Prioritization**: Organize recommendations by priority or impact to help the venue focus on the most critical changes first.
  - **Engagement**: Encourage a collaborative approach by inviting staff input and fostering a sense of ownership over the changes.
