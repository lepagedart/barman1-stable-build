Title: Improving Speed of Service at High-Volume Concert Venue

Tags: workflow, layout_flow, event_setup, speed_of_service

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Recommend ergonomic layouts, batching, and staffing strategies specific to live events.

Venue Context: Concert hall with 1,500 guests and multiple lobby bars. Guests often miss music sets waiting in long lines for drinks.

Prompt: During concerts, lines for drinks are insane and guests miss the show. How should we design bar setups and menus to maximize speed without sacrificing margins?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your bar setup and menu for speed during concerts, focus on streamlining service while maintaining profitability. Here are actionable recommendations:

**Bar Setup and Ergonomics**

1. **Station Map**:
   - Designate separate Service and Guest Wells to handle different volume needs.
   - Create clear traffic lanes for staff movement, minimizing collisions.

2. **Reach Zones**:
   - Zone A (0–18"): Essential tools, commonly used spirits, and glassware.
   - Zone B (18–30"): Secondary spirits and mixers.
   - Zone C (>30"): Reserve storage for less frequently used items.

3. **Rail Loadout**:
   - Arrange bottles from left to right based on frequency of use.
   - Position jiggers and tools centrally for quick access.
   - Ensure dump sinks and ice wells are conveniently located.

4. **Build Path**:
   - Standardize a FIFO process: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.

5. **Collision Controls**:
   - Implement one-way traffic lanes.
   - Position POS systems strategically to avoid bottlenecks.
   - Define "no stand" zones to keep pathways clear.

**Menu Adjustments for Speed**

1. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch high-demand cocktails to minimize individual drink assembly time.
   - Use liquor-only batching for extended shelf life, and ensure freshness with daily prep.

2. **Simplified Offerings**:
   - Focus on a concise menu with high-margin, easy-to-prepare cocktails.
   - Limit bespoke ingredients to reduce complexity and speed up service.

3. **Draft Cocktails**:
   - Consider offering a few high-volume cocktails on draft to expedite service.
   - This requires upfront investment but significantly reduces serve time.

4. **Pricing Strategy**:
   - Maintain margins by ensuring all cocktails have a similar pour cost percentage.
   - Regularly review and adjust pricing based on ingredient costs and sales data.

**Operational Checklist**

- Set up a 5-step action checklist for staff training on the new setup.
- Run a 20-minute mock service drill to test the efficiency of the new layout.
- Schedule quarterly reviews to assess margins and service speed.
- Implement a restock cadence to maintain par levels without disrupting service.

Using these strategies, you can enhance service speed during concerts, ensuring guests spend less time in line and more time enjoying the show, without compromising your margins.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - Include specific examples of high-margin, easy-to-prepare cocktails that align with the venue's theme or audience preferences.
  - Address potential challenges with pre-batching, such as maintaining quality and consistency.
  - Provide guidance on managing staff training and engagement to ensure buy-in and adherence to new processes.

- **Overreach:**
  - Avoid assuming that all venues can implement draft cocktails due to potential space and equipment constraints. Offer alternative solutions for venues unable to accommodate this.
  - Be cautious with suggesting significant upfront investments (e.g., draft systems) without assessing the venue's financial capacity and return on investment.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Introduce a feedback loop where staff can report on the effectiveness of the new setup and suggest improvements.
  - Develop a digital inventory tracking system to streamline restocking and reduce downtime.
  - Implement a customer feedback mechanism to gauge satisfaction with the new service speed and menu offerings.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more collaborative tone by suggesting these changes as part of a partnership with the venue, rather than directives.
  - Structure the response with clear headings and subheadings for each section to improve readability and quick reference.
  - Include a brief introduction and conclusion to frame the recommendations within the context of the venue's specific needs and goals.
