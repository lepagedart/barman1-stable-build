  "notes": "The response provides a structured plan with clear sections, but lacks specific venue context and assumes full control over inventory and supplier relationships. It could benefit from more concise bullet points and a balanced tone that considers both business and guest experience. Suggestions for data-driven decisions and risk management are missing, which would enhance feasibility and actionability.",
