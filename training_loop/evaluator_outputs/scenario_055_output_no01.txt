Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights**: Include metrics or case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in reducing waste and improving efficiency.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Suggest a process for gathering bartender feedback on these practices to continuously improve and adapt strategies.
  - **Cost Analysis**: Provide a brief cost-benefit analysis to justify the initial investment in training and pre-prep techniques.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Ingredient Cross-Utilization**: Avoid assuming all cocktails can share ingredients without compromising quality or brand identity. Recommend a pilot test for specific cocktails.
  - **Zero-Waste Techniques**: Ensure these techniques align with the venue's brand and customer expectations; not all venues may benefit equally from such practices.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management System**: Implement a digital system to track ingredient usage and waste, providing real-time data to adjust orders and reduce overstock.
  - **Regular Audits**: Schedule regular audits of waste levels and ingredient usage to identify areas for improvement and ensure compliance with new practices.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Precision**: Use bullet points for each strategy to enhance readability and focus on actionable steps.
  - **Engagement**: Encourage collaboration by inviting feedback from bartenders and management to refine and optimize the strategies.
  - **Professional Tone**: Maintain a formal and consultative tone, avoiding overly casual language to ensure the advice is taken seriously.
