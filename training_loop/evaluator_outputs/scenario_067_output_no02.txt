Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Sustainability Lens

Venue Context: A mid-sized hotel bar uses fresh citrus heavily, but is discarding a lot of spent fruit. Management is concerned about waste costs and sustainability image.

Prompt: What systems can we put in place to reduce waste in a citrus-heavy cocktail program while maintaining quality and presentation?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively reduce waste in a citrus-heavy cocktail program while maintaining quality and presentation, consider the following systems and strategies:

### Citrus Management Systems
- **Citrus Acid Solutions**: Implement a system for using citric and malic acid solutions as a supplement or alternative to fresh citrus. These can mimic the acidity of fresh juice without spoilage issues.
- **Juicing SOPs**: Create standard operating procedures for juicing, batching, and storing citrus. This ensures consistent quality and minimizes waste through precise measurements and proper handling.
- **Batching Citrus**: Pre-batch citrus juice for high-turnover cocktails. This reduces handling time and waste during service. Use airtight containers to extend shelf life.

### Waste Reduction Techniques
- **Full-Utilization Practices**: Use all parts of the citrus. For example, repurpose peels for garnishes like citrus twists or use them to make oleo saccharum.
- **Garnish Efficiency**: Opt for edible garnishes that can also enhance flavor, such as peel-only twists, which use less fruit.
  
### Inventory and Monitoring
- **Regular Inventory Audits**: Implement an inventory management system to track usage and spoilage. This helps identify patterns and adjust orders to reduce waste.
- **Forecasting and Ordering**: Use past sales data to better predict citrus needs, reducing over-ordering and spoilage.

### Guest Communication
- **Transparency and Education**: Communicate with guests about your sustainable practices. Highlight the benefits of your citrus management approach, which can enhance their appreciation of your commitment to quality and sustainability.

By integrating these systems, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining the integrity of your cocktails.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights**: Include specific metrics or KPIs to measure the success of waste reduction initiatives. For example, track the reduction in citrus waste by percentage over a set period.
  - **Supplier Collaboration**: Suggest partnerships with suppliers for more sustainable sourcing or bulk purchasing discounts to further reduce costs and waste.
  - **Staff Training**: Mention the importance of training staff on new procedures to ensure consistent implementation and buy-in.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Guest Communication**: Avoid assuming all guests will appreciate detailed explanations of sustainability practices. Instead, offer information selectively based on guest interest.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for staff to provide feedback on the effectiveness of new procedures, allowing for continuous improvement.
  - **Technology Integration**: Recommend using technology, such as inventory management software, to automate tracking and forecasting processes.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use bullet points for each recommendation to enhance readability and focus.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly indicate actions, such as "Implement," "Create," and "Use."
  - **Prioritization**: Order recommendations by impact or ease of implementation to guide focus and resource allocation.
