  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps to reduce cocktail pour costs while maintaining guest satisfaction. The response is clear and feasible, with practical examples and a focus on key performance indicators. However, it could benefit from more detailed guest sentiment measurement methods and a stronger emphasis on staff training and communication. The inclusion of a pilot testing phase and a structured feedback loop would enhance the approach. Overall, the response aligns well with the goals but could be slightly more concise and direct in its language.",
