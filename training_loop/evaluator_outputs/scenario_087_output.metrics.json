  "notes": "Lloyd's response is clear and provides a structured approach to optimizing bar operations. However, it lacks specific data to support the recommendations and does not fully consider the feasibility of implementing a one-way flow in all bar layouts. The response could benefit from more actionable steps and a stronger alignment with customer experience improvements. Additionally, the inclusion of a feedback loop and technology integration would enhance the proposal's effectiveness.",
