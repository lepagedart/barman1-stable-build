  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a clear plan for a corporate event. The menu design and batching strategy are practical, and the staffing flow is logical. However, the response could improve clarity by simplifying the service flow and using more direct language. Including guest preferences and a backup plan would enhance alignment with client needs. The structure is mostly consistent, but some sections could benefit from more uniform formatting.",
