  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible, actionable steps for integrating the new gin into the bar program. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise bullet points. The alignment with distributor relationships and operational considerations is strong, but the response could include more on guest feedback and market analysis as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section.",
