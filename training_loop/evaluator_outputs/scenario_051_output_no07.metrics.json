  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for designing a sustainable fall cocktail menu. It effectively balances sustainability, guest experience, and cost management. However, it could benefit from a brief market analysis and guest feedback loop to ensure alignment with consumer preferences. Additionally, the response should consider geographic variations in ingredient availability and simplify language to enhance clarity. Overall, it is a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
