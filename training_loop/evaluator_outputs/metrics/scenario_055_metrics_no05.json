  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for waste reduction in a bar setting. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and readability. However, the response could benefit from more tailored examples based on venue type and a more concise presentation. The suggestions are feasible but may require adaptation for different venue capabilities. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt's requirements but could improve with more specific context and scalability considerations.",
