  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a detailed plan for efficient pop-up bar operations. Clarity is good, though some sections could be more concise. The plan is actionable but could benefit from more focus on customer experience and sustainability. Alignment with modern values and flexibility in guidelines would enhance the response.",
