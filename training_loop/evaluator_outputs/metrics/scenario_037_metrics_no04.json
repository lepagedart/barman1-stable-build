  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a corporate holiday event. The menu design, batching strategy, and staffing flow are feasible and actionable. However, the response could benefit from addressing guest preferences and dietary restrictions more explicitly. The suggestions for improvement in 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' are valid and enhance the overall plan. The use of bullet points and action-oriented language is effective, but consistency in format could be improved slightly. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor adjustments needed.",
