  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas such as financial impact, supplier integration, and operational processes. It provides actionable steps and maintains a balance between supplier goals and guest experience. However, it could benefit from more precise language and inclusion of guest experience metrics and technology integration for inventory management. The feedback loop and training evaluation processes could be more detailed to ensure effectiveness.",
