  "notes": "The response provides a comprehensive approach to a low-waste citrus and ice program, aligning with sustainability goals. However, it lacks clarity in some technical aspects and could benefit from simplified explanations. The structure is generally clear but could be more concise. Actionability is moderate, with room for more specific guidance on implementation. Alignment with sustainability goals is strong, but additional details on supplier collaboration and customer engagement would enhance the response.",
