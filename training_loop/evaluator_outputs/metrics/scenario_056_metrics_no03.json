  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides practical strategies for improving cocktail program profitability, but lacks venue-specific context and prioritization. Ingredient suggestions may not align with brand positioning. The structure could be more prioritized, and the financial analysis needs clearer context. Actionable steps are present but could be more detailed. Overall, the response is feasible but needs refinement for clarity and alignment with venue goals.",
