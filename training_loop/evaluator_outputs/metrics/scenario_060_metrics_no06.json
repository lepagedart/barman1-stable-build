  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a detailed plan for efficient pop-up bar operations. Clarity is good, though could be improved with more concise bullet points. Actionability is strong, but could benefit from more customer engagement strategies. Alignment with modern values like sustainability is noted as a missing piece.",
