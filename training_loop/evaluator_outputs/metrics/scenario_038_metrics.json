  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a solid foundation for a winter-themed cocktail menu with practical batching strategies. However, it lacks specific venue context and customer demographic insights, which are crucial for tailoring the menu effectively. The response could benefit from a more concise structure and clearer action steps. Additionally, addressing local regulations and inventory management would enhance feasibility and alignment with venue needs.",
