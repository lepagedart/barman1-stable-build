  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible strategies for reducing cocktail pour costs while maintaining guest sentiment. The clarity is good, but could be improved with more precise language and specific examples. The structure is mostly consistent, though some sections could be streamlined for better readability. The actionability is strong, with clear steps outlined, but could benefit from more detailed timelines and responsible parties. The alignment with the goal is good, but the response could include more on measuring and improving guest sentiment, as well as staff training and communication strategies.",
