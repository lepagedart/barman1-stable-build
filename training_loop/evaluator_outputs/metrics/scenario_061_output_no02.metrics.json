  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing costs and waste in a cocktail program. The suggestions are feasible and cover a range of operational aspects. However, the response could benefit from addressing the environmental impact and customer perception more explicitly. Additionally, while the use of advanced techniques like agar clarification is mentioned, simpler alternatives for smaller venues could be highlighted. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with more emphasis on sustainability and customer communication.",
