  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-aligned with distributor priorities and maintains the desired beverage margin. The plan is feasible and actionable, with clear steps and incentives. However, clarity could be improved by simplifying some sections and using more concise language. The structure is mostly consistent, but some sections could benefit from bullet points for better readability. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
