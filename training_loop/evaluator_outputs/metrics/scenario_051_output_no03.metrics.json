  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable steps for designing a sustainable fall cocktail menu. It effectively balances sustainability, guest experience, and cost management. However, it could benefit from including market analysis and supplier partnerships to ensure alignment with local trends and ingredient availability. The response is mostly concise, but could improve in clarity by simplifying some sections and ensuring all points are directly actionable.",
