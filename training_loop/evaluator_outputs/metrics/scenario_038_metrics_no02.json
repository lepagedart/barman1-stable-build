  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a winter-themed cocktail menu. It includes specific recipes, batching strategies, and operational notes, which are actionable and feasible. However, it lacks venue context and audience consideration, which are crucial for alignment. The response could benefit from more concise language and a slightly more focused menu to enhance clarity and efficiency.",
