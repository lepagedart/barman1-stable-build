  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for featuring the new gin. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of supporting distributor relationships without overcommitting resources. Clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise language. The addition of guest feedback mechanisms and staff incentives in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section enhances the overall strategy. However, the response could prioritize actions more clearly to avoid overwhelming the client.",
