  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas for optimizing throughput at pop-up bars. It provides clear strategies and an actionable checklist. However, it could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization in the action checklist. The 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section offers valuable additional insights but could be more integrated into the main response.",
