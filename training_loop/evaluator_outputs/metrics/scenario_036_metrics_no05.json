  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving service at a pool bar. The suggestions are clear and feasible, focusing on menu simplification, operational adjustments, and an action checklist. However, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on customer experience and technology integration, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. The tone is generally supportive, but could be more empathetic. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
