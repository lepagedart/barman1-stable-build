  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan for optimizing poolside bar stations. The use of sections and bullet points aids clarity and readability. The response is feasible and aligns with the goal of improving service efficiency. However, it could benefit from a stronger focus on guest experience and staff training, as well as simplifying some of the setup instructions to avoid overwhelming staff. The suggestion for a mock service drill is practical, but a more iterative approach could be more effective. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
