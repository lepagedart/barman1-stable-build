  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers essential compliance steps for launching a patio bar. It is clear and actionable, with a focus on licensing, signage, staff training, and operational checklists. However, it could benefit from including a weather contingency plan, noise considerations, and waste management guidelines. Simplifying the batching rules and incorporating digital tools for compliance could enhance feasibility and efficiency. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be more concise and prioritize critical steps more effectively.",
