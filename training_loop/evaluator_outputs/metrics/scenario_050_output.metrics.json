  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for aligning a cocktail menu with distributor portfolios. The response is clear and feasible, with a good balance between financial objectives and guest experience. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest feedback integration and competitive analysis. The suggestions for simplifying financial tracking and avoiding excessive SKU rationalization are valuable. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
