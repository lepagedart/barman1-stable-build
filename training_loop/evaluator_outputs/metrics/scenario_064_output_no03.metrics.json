  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive training plan. It clearly outlines the session's components and offers actionable steps. However, it could benefit from more venue-specific context and consideration of staff experience levels. The suggestion to break down the session if it's too long is practical, but the response could include more interactive elements to enhance engagement.",
