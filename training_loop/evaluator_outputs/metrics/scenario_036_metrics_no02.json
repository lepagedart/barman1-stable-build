  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible solutions for improving service at a pool bar. The clarity is good, but could be enhanced with more concise bullet points. The actionability is strong, though the addition of staff training and technology integration would improve it. The alignment with the venue context is appropriate, but the tone could be slightly more formal to better suit a professional audience.",
