  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a range of strategies to reduce costs and waste in a cocktail program, but lacks some clarity and feasibility for smaller venues. The structure is generally clear, but could benefit from more directive language and consideration of venue size. The response aligns with the goal of cost and waste reduction, but misses addressing sustainability and customer perception. Overall, it's a solid response but could be improved with more tailored and actionable advice.",
