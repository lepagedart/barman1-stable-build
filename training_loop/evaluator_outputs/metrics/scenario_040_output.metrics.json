  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive strategy for designing a distributor-sponsored cocktail menu. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise language and bullet points for readability. The feasibility is strong, with practical steps outlined, but could include more specific details on distributor collaboration and inventory management. The structure is logical, with clear sections and a summary checklist. The actionability is high, with actionable steps and promotional strategies. The alignment with the venue's identity and financial goals is well-considered, though more emphasis on feedback mechanisms and performance metrics would enhance the plan.",
