  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable recommendations for optimizing bar setup and menu for speed during concerts. The response is feasible and aligns with the goal of improving service speed while maintaining profitability. However, it could benefit from including specific examples or case studies, addressing potential challenges, and tailoring recommendations to different venue types. Additionally, a more consultative tone and a brief introduction summarizing the venue's challenges would enhance clarity and engagement.",
