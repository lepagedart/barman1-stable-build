  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a corporate event. The menu design, batching strategy, and staffing flow are feasible and actionable. However, it could benefit from addressing guest preferences and sustainability practices. The suggestion to reduce cocktail options for simplicity and adjust staffing ratios is valid. The tone is professional, but further conciseness and clarity in bullet points could enhance readability.",
