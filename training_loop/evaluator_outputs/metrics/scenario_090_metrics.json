  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key operational aspects of setting up a festival bar. The use of headings and bullet points aids clarity and readability. The plan is feasible, though it could benefit from more detailed contingency plans for utilities and simplified batching strategies. Actionability is strong, with a clear checklist provided. Alignment with the prompt is good, but additional focus on safety, compliance, and customer experience would enhance the response. Overall, it's a solid plan with room for minor improvements.",
