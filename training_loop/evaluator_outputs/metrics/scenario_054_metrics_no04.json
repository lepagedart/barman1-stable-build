  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible, actionable steps for integrating the new gin into the bar program. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise bullet points. The alignment with distributor relationships and operational considerations is strong, but it could include more on guest engagement and feedback mechanisms. Overall, it's a solid response with room for minor improvements in clarity and guest interaction strategies.",
