  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for controlling beverage costs. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the suggestions are feasible and aligned with the goal of maintaining a quality guest experience. However, the response could benefit from incorporating data-driven insights and supplier negotiations, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Additionally, caution is advised in batching and portion control to avoid negative customer perceptions. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements suggested.",
