  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key compliance and operational areas for a mobile bar service. It is actionable and feasible, with clear steps outlined. However, it could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization of tasks. The response aligns well with the prompt but lacks specific venue context and local regulation details. The suggestion to avoid specific insurance advice is valid, and the addition of a compliance calendar and feedback loop would enhance the response.",
