  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a detailed plan for efficient pop-up bar operations. Clarity is good, but could be improved with more concise bullet points. Actionability is high, though some elements like customer engagement and feedback loops are missing. Alignment with the prompt is strong, but could benefit from addressing health and safety protocols.",
