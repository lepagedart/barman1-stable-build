  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing waste in bar operations. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the suggestions are feasible for implementation. However, the response could benefit from including data-driven insights and customer engagement strategies, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Additionally, care should be taken not to overreach with supplier recommendations without understanding the venue's specific context.",
