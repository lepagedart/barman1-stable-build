  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas such as financial impact, supplier integration, and operational processes. It provides actionable steps and maintains a focus on aligning with Breakthru's portfolio. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest-centric strategies and data-driven decisions. The complexity of incentive tracking and staff training might be challenging for some venues, and the response could be more concise in certain areas.",
