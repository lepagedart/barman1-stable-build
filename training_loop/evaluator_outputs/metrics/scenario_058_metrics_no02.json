  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers essential compliance steps for launching a patio bar. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and readability. The response is actionable, with clear steps and a checklist for shift-opening. However, it could benefit from more concise language and prioritization of steps. The feedback section provides useful insights but could be more integrated into the main response for better alignment. Overall, it's a strong, client-ready response with minor areas for improvement.",
