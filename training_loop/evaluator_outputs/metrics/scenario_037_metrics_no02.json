  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a corporate holiday event. The menu design, batching strategy, and staffing flow are feasible and actionable. However, it could benefit from addressing guest preferences and having a backup plan. The staffing ratio might need adjustment, and the service flow could be simplified. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with more detailed inventory management and contingency planning.",
