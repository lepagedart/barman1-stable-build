  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving cocktail program profitability. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of maintaining guest satisfaction. However, the response could benefit from more concise bullet points and a clearer prioritization of actions. Additionally, incorporating guest feedback mechanisms and addressing seasonal and sustainability considerations would enhance the response. The tone is generally appropriate, but acknowledging staff concerns could improve empathy and engagement.",
