  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for waste reduction in a bar setting. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the suggestions are feasible and aligned with the goal of maintaining efficiency. However, the response could benefit from including data-driven insights and a cost analysis to strengthen the recommendations. Additionally, the feedback loop and inventory management suggestions in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section are valuable and could be integrated into the main response for a more comprehensive approach.",
