  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for managing service with limited staff. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of maintaining efficiency and margins. However, it could benefit from addressing guest experience and staff training more explicitly, as well as considering venues with limited resources. The response is clear but could be more concise in some areas.",
