  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan for training staff in upselling techniques. The use of bullet points and sections enhances readability. However, the response could benefit from more specific venue context to tailor the approach and a stronger emphasis on customer sensitivity and diverse preferences. The suggestions in 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' are valuable but could be more concise and integrated into the main response.",
