  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving cocktail program profitability. It covers ingredient optimization, batching, menu adjustments, and financial analysis effectively. However, it could benefit from including guest feedback mechanisms, seasonal adjustments, and sustainability practices. The response maintains a good balance between cost-saving and quality assurance but could enhance empathy and focus on guest experience.",
