  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for efficiently managing a banquet with limited resources. The batching strategy and prep essentials are practical and feasible. However, the response could improve by addressing guest preferences, non-alcoholic options, and allergy considerations. The suggestion for a more comprehensive mock service and inventory management is valuable. Consistent use of bullet points and imperative language enhances clarity and actionability.",
