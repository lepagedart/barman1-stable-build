  "notes": "The response is well-aligned with the venue context and provides a comprehensive cocktail program. Clarity and structure are generally good, though some sections could benefit from more concise bullet points. Feasibility is addressed with practical batching and cost notes, but could include more on ingredient sourcing and sustainability. Actionability is strong with clear operational notes, though could be enhanced with more detailed training and inventory management suggestions.",
