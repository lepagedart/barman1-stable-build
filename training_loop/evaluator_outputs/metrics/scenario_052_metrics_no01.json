  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers essential compliance and operational steps for a mobile bar service. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization of tasks. The addition of local regulations and supplier coordination would enhance alignment with client needs. The suggestion to avoid specific insurance details is appropriate, but the response could be more concise and use more direct language as suggested in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section.",
