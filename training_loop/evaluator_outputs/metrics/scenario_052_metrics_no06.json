  "notes": "Lloyd's response is clear and provides a structured checklist for compliance, but lacks specific contextualization for different venues or event types. The feasibility is moderate as it assumes a generic approach without considering local variations. The structure is decent but could be more concise. Actionability is present but could be enhanced with more direct language. Alignment with the client's specific needs is weak, as it doesn't address local regulation variability or technology utilization.",
