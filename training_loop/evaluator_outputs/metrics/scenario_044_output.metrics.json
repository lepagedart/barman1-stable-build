  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive approach to compliance and training for alcohol service. It includes clear systems and training methods, but could benefit from more venue-specific details and a clearer definition of 'peak events.' The suggestion for biannual training might be excessive, and the scripts could allow for more flexibility. Overall, the response is actionable and aligns well with the goal of reducing liability risks.",
