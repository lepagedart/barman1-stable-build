  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive strategy for designing a seasonal menu. It balances creative integrity with portfolio alignment and addresses guest and distributor satisfaction. The response is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from including market analysis and a feedback loop as suggested in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. The focus on distributor alignment is noted, but overall, the response maintains a good balance. The tone and structure are appropriate, with clear headings and concise language.",
