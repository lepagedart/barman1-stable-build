  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear strategy for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. It includes actionable steps and a checklist for implementation. However, it could benefit from a stronger focus on guest experience and sustainability practices. Additionally, it should consider the varying resources of different venues and simplify complex techniques. The response aligns well with the prompt but could enhance engagement through a more narrative approach.",
