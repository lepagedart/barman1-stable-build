  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible, actionable steps for integrating the new gin into the bar program. The clarity could be improved by specifying the venue context and target audience. The structure is generally good, but a more consultative tone and clearer headings could enhance readability. The response aligns well with the goal of supporting distributor relationships while managing resources effectively.",
