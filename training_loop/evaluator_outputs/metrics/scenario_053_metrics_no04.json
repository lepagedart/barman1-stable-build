  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a detailed plan for optimizing poolside bar stations. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from simpler language and more bullet points for quick reference. The feasibility is high, as the suggestions are practical and actionable. The response aligns well with the goal of improving service efficiency, but could include more on guest experience and staff training. Overall, it's a strong response with room for minor improvements in clarity and alignment with specific venue needs.",
