  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key aspects of managing a bar at a festival. It provides clear steps and roles, making it actionable. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest flow management and waste management. The response is mostly aligned with the prompt, but could be more concise and focused on essential points.",
