  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for addressing the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and actionable, with a focus on standardization, training, and guest engagement. However, the response could benefit from more emphasis on data collection and staff feedback mechanisms. The tone is generally collaborative, but could be slightly more inclusive. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
