  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key compliance areas for a mobile bar service. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from more concise language and consistent use of bullet points. The addition of risk assessment and supplier verification would enhance the response. The suggestion to consult an insurance advisor is appropriate, but the response could be more concise overall. Alignment with the client's needs is good, but could be improved with more tailored advice.",
