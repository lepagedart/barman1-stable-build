  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for training staff in upselling techniques. The use of headings and a checklist enhances clarity and organization. However, the response could benefit from more context about the venue and its specific challenges. Additionally, suggesting scalable options for venues with limited resources would improve feasibility. The alignment with the venue's goals and culture should be considered when recommending financial incentives.",
