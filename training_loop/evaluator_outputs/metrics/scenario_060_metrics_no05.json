  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for operating a pop-up bar efficiently. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise bullet points. The feasibility is strong, with practical suggestions for menu design, batching, and layout. The structure is logical, but could be improved with more consistent formatting. The actionability is high, with clear steps outlined. The alignment with the prompt is good, though it could include more on customer experience and feedback mechanisms.",
