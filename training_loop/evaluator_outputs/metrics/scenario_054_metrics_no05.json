  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for integrating the new gin into the bar program. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of supporting distributor relationships while managing resources effectively. However, the response could benefit from more emphasis on guest engagement strategies and a clearer prioritization of actions to avoid overwhelming the venue. The tone is generally supportive, but could be slightly more precise to ensure clarity for all operators.",
