  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable strategies for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. The response aligns with the venue's needs and offers feasible solutions. However, it could benefit from a stronger focus on guest experience, cost management, and sustainability practices. Additionally, the response should ensure that the bar team's capabilities are considered when suggesting culinary techniques. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
