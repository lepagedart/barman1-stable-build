  "notes": "Lloyd's response is clear and provides a structured approach to reducing waste in bar operations. However, it lacks data-driven insights and customer engagement strategies, which are crucial for demonstrating impact and enhancing brand image. The feasibility of some suggestions, like batching, may not be applicable to all bars, and the response could benefit from prioritizing actions based on impact and ease of implementation. Additionally, the response could be more actionable with specific technology recommendations and a supportive tone that encourages experimentation.",
