  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable recommendations for optimizing bar setup and menu for speed during concerts. The response is clear and feasible, with practical suggestions like pre-batching cocktails and creating efficient bar layouts. However, it could benefit from including specific examples or case studies to enhance credibility. Additionally, addressing potential challenges and providing a timeline for implementation would improve the response. The tone is professional, but a more structured format with numbered sections could enhance clarity. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt's requirements.",
