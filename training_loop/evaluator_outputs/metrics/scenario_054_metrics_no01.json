  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for integrating the new gin into the bar program. It effectively balances the need to feature the gin with operational considerations. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest engagement and feedback mechanisms. The response is clear and feasible, but could be more concise and prioritize actions more explicitly.",
