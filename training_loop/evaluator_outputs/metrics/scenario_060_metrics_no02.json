  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, providing a detailed plan for efficient pop-up bar operations. Clarity is good, though some sections could benefit from more concise bullet points. The plan is actionable but could include more on customer flow management and staff training. Alignment with the pop-up bar context is strong, but simplifying roles and backup plans could enhance practicality.",
