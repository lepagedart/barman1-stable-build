  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key operational aspects for a pop-up bar. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from addressing customer experience and staff training. The backup plans are practical, but the layout instructions might be too specific for all venues. Overall, it's a strong plan with room for minor improvements.",
