  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan to address the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and align with the goal of improving guest experience and trust. However, the response could benefit from more emphasis on data collection and staff accountability, as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Additionally, while the tone is professional, it could incorporate more empathetic language to reassure guests.",
