  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan for implementing a straw policy. It aligns with sustainability goals and considers accessibility needs. However, it could benefit from more specific venue context and guest demographic considerations. The feedback mechanism and inventory management suggestions are valuable but could be more detailed. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
