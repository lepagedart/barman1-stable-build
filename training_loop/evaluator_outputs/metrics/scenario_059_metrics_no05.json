  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for integrating Breakthru's portfolio into the cocktail program. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the plan is feasible with actionable steps. However, it could benefit from more guest-centric metrics and a simplified incentive tracking process. The response aligns well with the goal of maintaining a premium guest experience while meeting portfolio targets.",
