  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides feasible strategies for waste reduction in a citrus-heavy cocktail program. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise bullet points. The actionability is strong, with clear steps outlined, but could be improved with more specific metrics for success. The alignment with the prompt is solid, though the guest communication section might overestimate guest interest in sustainability details.",
