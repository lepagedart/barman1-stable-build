  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving service at the pool bar. The suggestions are clear and feasible, focusing on menu simplification, operational adjustments, and an action checklist. However, the response could benefit from including staff training and customer feedback mechanisms, as well as addressing legal aspects of pre-batching cocktails. The tone is mostly professional, but consistency could be improved. Overall, the response aligns well with the venue's needs but could be enhanced with additional details and prioritization of recommendations.",
