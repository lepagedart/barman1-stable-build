  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for training staff in upselling. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more specific examples tailored to different venue types. The feasibility is strong, with practical suggestions like role-playing and tasting sessions. The alignment with the goal of enhancing upselling skills is clear, but could be improved by addressing individual staff differences more explicitly. Overall, it's a solid response with room for minor enhancements.",
