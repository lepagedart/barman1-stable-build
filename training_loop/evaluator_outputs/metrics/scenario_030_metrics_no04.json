  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a feasible plan for training staff in upselling techniques. The clarity could be improved by addressing the specific context of the venue and tailoring the advice accordingly. The structure is mostly clear, but could benefit from more concise bullet points. The actionability is strong, with clear steps and incentives outlined. Alignment with the venue's needs could be enhanced by considering existing challenges and staff comfort levels.",
