  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable recommendations for optimizing bar setup and menu for speed during concerts. The response is clear and feasible, though it could benefit from specific examples and a more collaborative tone. The suggestions for pre-batching and draft cocktails are practical, but financial constraints should be considered. The inclusion of a phased implementation plan and feedback loop would enhance the actionability and alignment with venue needs.",
