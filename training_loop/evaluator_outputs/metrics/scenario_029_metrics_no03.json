  "notes": "Lloyd's response is clear and provides a structured approach to optimizing bar setup and menu for speed. However, it lacks data-driven insights and staff feedback, which are crucial for practical implementation. The feasibility of some suggestions, like draft cocktails, may be limited by budget constraints. The response could benefit from prioritizing recommendations and ensuring alignment with brand identity. Additional considerations like customer flow analysis and sustainability practices are valuable but not fully integrated into the main recommendations.",
