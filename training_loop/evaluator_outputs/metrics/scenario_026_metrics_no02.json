  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for addressing the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and actionable, focusing on standardization, training, and guest engagement. However, the response could benefit from more specific context about the venue and guest complaints to tailor the solutions more effectively. Additionally, the tone could be more empathetic, and the response could include a phased implementation plan to ensure feasibility across different staff capabilities.",
