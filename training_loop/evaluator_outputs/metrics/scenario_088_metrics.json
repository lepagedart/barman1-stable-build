  "notes": "The response is well-structured and provides a clear step-by-step guide. However, it lacks specific venue context and could benefit from a more conversational tone. The feasibility of the recommendations is not fully addressed, as it assumes the venue has the resources for integration. Including a risk assessment and success metrics would enhance actionability and alignment with venue needs.",
