Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Menu With Cost Guardrails

Tags: portfolio, profitability, menu_engineering, supplier_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Activate Portfolio + Profitability lenses. Tie features to supplier priorities, rebates, and margin floors.

Venue Context: Neighborhood restaurant bar, 14 taps, 10 cocktails. Two distributors offer co-op dollars if we feature 3 SKUs each and meet quarterly case goals.

Prompt: Draft a seasonal menu plan that aligns with two distributorsâ€™ priority SKUs while protecting a 78% beverage margin target. Include: SKU selections with rationale, cost cards, rebate/co-op accounting, staff spiffs, and a 6-week rotation calendar. Add a one-pager for FOH training and a simple scorecard to track sell-through vs goals.

Lloyd's Response:

To create a seasonal menu plan that aligns with distributor priorities while maintaining a 78% beverage margin, here's a structured approach:

### SKU Selection & Rationale
1. **Distributor A Priority SKU**: 
   - **Vodka Brand X**: Widely recognized with strategic pricing incentives. 
   - **Rationale**: Vodka is versatile and can be featured in multiple cocktails; distributor offers a rebate on volume purchases.
   
2. **Distributor B Priority SKU**: 
   - **Gin Brand Y**: Premium brand with a strong market presence.
   - **Rationale**: Fits into classic and modern cocktail profiles; co-op marketing funds available to support promotions.

### Menu Design
- **Vodka-Focused Cocktail**: Seasonal Vodka Mule
  - Cost-effective mixers and garnishes to maximize margin.
- **Gin-Focused Cocktail**: Autumnal Gin & Tonic
  - Utilizes seasonal botanicals or garnishes to elevate experience.

### Cost Cards
- **Vodka Mule**: 
  - Vodka Brand X: $0.50 per 1 oz
  - Ginger Beer: $0.20 per 4 oz
  - Lime Juice: $0.05
  - Garnish: Mint Sprig: $0.10
  - **Total Cost**: $0.85
  - **Menu Price**: $10.00 (78.5% margin)

- **Autumnal Gin & Tonic**:
  - Gin Brand Y: $0.70 per 1 oz
  - Tonic Water: $0.15 per 4 oz
  - Seasonal Garnish: $0.10
  - **Total Cost**: $0.95
  - **Menu Price**: $12.00 (79.2% margin)

### Rebate/Co-op Accounting
- **Vodka Brand X**: $200 rebate after 100 bottles.
- **Gin Brand Y**: $150 co-op fund for promotional materials.

### Staff Spiffs
- **Incentive Program**: $5 for every 20 Vodka Mules or Autumnal Gin & Tonics sold.
- **Objective**: Encourage staff engagement and upselling.

### 6-Week Rotation Calendar
- **Weeks 1-2**: Launch Vodka Mule with promotional push.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Focus on Autumnal Gin & Tonic, leveraging co-op marketing.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Highlight both cocktails with a "Seasonal Pairing" offer.

### FOH Training One-Pager
- **Cocktail Profiles**: Key flavor notes and suggested pairings.
- **Talking Points**: Brand stories and unique selling points.
- **Upsell Techniques**: Encourage guest interaction and customization.

### Scorecard for Sell-Through
- **Metrics**: Number of each cocktail sold vs target.
- **Weekly Review**: Adjust incentives or promotions based on performance.
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather staff input on guest preferences and menu reception.

### Summary Checklist
1. Set up distributor meetings to confirm rebates and co-op funds.
2. Print cost cards and distribute to bar staff.
3. Implement FOH training and provide staff spiff details.
4. Launch initial promotions according to the calendar.
5. Monitor scorecard weekly and adjust tactics as needed. 

This plan ensures distributor alignment, maintains margins, and encourages staff engagement, all while keeping the guest experience at the forefront.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Market Analysis:** Include a brief analysis of current market trends or consumer preferences to justify the selection of Vodka and Gin as focus spirits.
  - **Competitor Benchmarking:** Compare the proposed menu items and pricing with competitors to ensure competitiveness and uniqueness.
  - **Guest Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a system for collecting guest feedback on the new menu items to inform future menu adjustments.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Detailed Cost Breakdown:** While detailed, the cost card section could be simplified for clarity. Focus on key cost drivers and overall margin impact rather than granular details.
  - **Rebate/Co-op Complexity:** Simplify the rebate and co-op accounting section to focus on net financial impact rather than detailed terms.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Integrated POS System:** Ensure the POS system can track sales of specific cocktails to facilitate the incentive program and scorecard tracking.
  - **Automated Reporting:** Implement automated weekly reports to track sales metrics and staff performance against targets.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use imperative verbs to clearly direct actions (e.g., "Launch," "Monitor," "Implement").
  - **Consistency:** Maintain consistent formatting for all sections, especially in cost card and rebate sections, to avoid confusion.

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - **Visual Aids:** Consider using visual aids like charts or infographics in the FOH training materials to enhance staff understanding and retention.
  - **Cross-Department Collaboration:** Engage with marketing and operations teams early to ensure alignment on promotional efforts and operational feasibility.
