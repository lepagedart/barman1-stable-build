Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame recommendations through supplier incentives and brand leverage.

Venue Context: Martignetti is pushing a new gin brand and offering rebates. The restaurant wants to benefit without overwhelming the menu.

Prompt: How can we feature this new gin in a way that supports the distributor relationship but doesn’t overcommit the bar program?

Lloyd's Response:

To feature the new gin effectively while supporting your distributor relationship without overcommitting your bar program, consider the following approach:

### Strategic Feature of New Gin

1. **Highlight Signature Cocktail**: 
   - Create a signature cocktail that prominently features the new gin. This could be a modern twist on a classic like a Gin & Tonic with unique house-made tonic syrup or a variation of a Negroni using the gin as the base.
   - Ensure the cocktail is easy to make, using only a few additional ingredients that you already stock.

2. **Menu Integration**:
   - Include the gin in at least one other cocktail on the menu to reinforce its presence without overwhelming your inventory or staff training needs.
   - Consider a simple gin-based highball or a refreshing spritz, which can be quickly assembled and appeal to a wide range of guests.

3. **Distributor Collaboration**:
   - Work with your distributor to understand any promotional support they offer, such as co-branded menus or pricing incentives, and leverage these to enhance the gin's visibility and profitability.
   - Use any provided point-of-sale materials to highlight the gin on your menu or bar area, creating a consistent and noticeable presence.

4. **Operational Considerations**:
   - Keep the cocktail builds simple to ensure they do not slow down service, especially during peak hours.
   - Train staff on the unique selling points of the gin, equipping them with a short script to upsell the gin cocktails effectively.

5. **Cost Management**:
   - Maintain a target pour cost of ≤ 20% for the gin cocktails. If the gin is expensive, adjust other ingredients to balance the cost.
   - Use existing garnishes and mixers to keep additional costs down and avoid unnecessary SKU proliferation.

### Action Checklist
- Develop 1–2 gin cocktails that align with your brand and guest preferences.
- Collaborate with your distributor for marketing support.
- Train staff on the gin’s features and upselling techniques.
- Monitor sales and feedback to adjust offerings and maintain guest satisfaction. 

By strategically integrating the new gin into your bar program, you can enhance your relationship with the distributor and offer appealing options to your guests without overextending your resources.

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Engagement**: Include strategies for engaging guests directly, such as tastings or events, to create excitement around the new gin.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Implement a system for collecting guest feedback on the new gin cocktails to refine offerings based on real-time data.

  - **Inventory Management**: Set up a tracking system to monitor the new gin's usage and sales, ensuring it aligns with inventory goals.
  - **Staff Training**: Develop a concise training module focused on the new gin, including tasting notes and upselling techniques, to ensure staff are well-prepared without overwhelming them.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Streamline the response by focusing on the most impactful actions, avoiding over-explanation of basic concepts.
  - **Clarity**: Use clear, direct language to outline steps, ensuring the venue can easily implement recommendations.
  - **Prioritization**: Clearly prioritize actions to guide the venue on where to start and what to focus on for maximum impact.
