Venue Context: An event company runs mobile bars for weddings and festivals and wants to avoid legal pitfalls.

Prompt: What steps should we take to make sure our mobile bar service is fully compliant before peak season?

Lloyd's Response:

To ensure your mobile bar service is fully compliant before the peak season, follow these focused steps:

### Legal Compliance
1. **Licensing and Permits**: Verify that all necessary licenses and permits are up-to-date and appropriately cover the areas where you will operate. This includes liquor licenses, health permits, and any local event-specific permits.

2. **Insurance Coverage**: Review and update your insurance policies to ensure they cover liability for off-site events. Consider increasing coverage if you expect higher traffic or more significant events.

### Operational Preparedness
3. **Equipment Check**: Conduct a thorough inspection of all equipment, including portable bars, refrigeration units, and glassware. Repair or replace any faulty items to prevent service disruptions.

4. **Sanitation Protocols**: Establish clear sanitation practices, especially for mobile setups, to comply with health regulations. This includes portable handwashing stations and proper waste disposal systems.

### Staff Training
5. **Compliance Training**: Train staff on compliance, focusing on responsible service of alcohol, checking IDs, and handling potential legal issues. Include scenario-based training for handling common compliance challenges.

6. **Operational Drills**: Run mock service drills to ensure staff are familiar with setup, teardown, and service protocols. This helps identify any areas needing improvement before the high season begins.

### Documentation and Reporting
7. **Documentation Review**: Ensure all documentation, such as contracts, service agreements, and compliance records, are in order and easily accessible.

8. **Incident Reporting System**: Implement or review your incident reporting system to ensure quick and efficient documentation of any compliance issues that arise during service.

### Action Checklist
- Confirm all licenses and permits are current and comprehensive.
- Update insurance to cover all operational aspects adequately.
- Inspect and service all mobile bar equipment.
- Implement strict sanitation protocols.
- Train staff on compliance and operational procedures.
- Conduct service drills to test readiness.
- Organize and ensure access to all necessary documentation.
- Review and refine your incident reporting system.

By addressing these areas, your mobile bar service will not only be compliant but also poised to deliver a seamless guest experience during the peak season.
