  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a detailed plan for optimizing bar operations during a high-volume period. The instructions are clear and actionable, though they could benefit from simplification to avoid overwhelming staff. The response aligns with the goal of increasing efficiency but could include more on customer interaction and staff training. A contingency plan and use of technology are suggested improvements.",
