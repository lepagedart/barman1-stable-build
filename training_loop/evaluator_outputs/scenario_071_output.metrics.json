  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a detailed plan for optimizing bar operations during a high-volume period. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from slightly more concise language. The feasibility is strong, with practical steps outlined, but the complexity might overwhelm some staff. The structure is logical, and the actionability is high, with clear steps and drills. Alignment with the scenario is good, though it could include more on customer interaction and staff training as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section.",
