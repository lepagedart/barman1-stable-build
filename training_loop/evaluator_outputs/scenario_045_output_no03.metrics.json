  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for leveraging POS and inventory technology. It covers system integration, accuracy improvement, and forecasting enhancement effectively. However, it could benefit from addressing venue-specific customization, staff training, and customer feedback integration. The tone could be more engaging, and prioritization in the checklist could be clearer. Overall, it's a strong response with room for minor improvements.",
