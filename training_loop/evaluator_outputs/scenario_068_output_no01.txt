Venue Context: A city summer festival needs to serve 2,000 people in a day with two temporary outdoor bars. Power and refrigeration are limited.

Prompt: Design the workflow, batching plan, and station setup for two outdoor bars at a 2,000-person festival with limited infrastructure.

Lloyd's Response:

For a 2,000-person festival with limited infrastructure, efficiency and speed are crucial to keep lines moving and guests satisfied. Here's a comprehensive plan focusing on workflow, batching, and station setup:

### Workflow & Station Setup

1. **Bar Layout & Stations**:
   - **Two Bars**: Position bars at opposite ends of the festival to distribute traffic.
   - **Bar Stations**: Each bar should have 3 primary stations:
     - **Service Station**: For direct guest service, equipped with POS systems.
     - **Prep Station**: For batching and restocking, set slightly back to prevent collisions.
     - **Garnish/Finishing Station**: Between the service and prep stations for quick access to garnishes and final touches.

2. **Bar Equipment**:
   - **Ice Storage**: Use insulated bins or coolers; ensure regular restocking from a central ice supply every 30 minutes.
   - **Glassware**: Use recyclable or compostable cups to reduce waste and avoid glass breakage.
   - **Beverage Dispensers**: Use kegged or bottled cocktails for speed; place draft lines or dispensers at the service station.

3. **Staffing Roles**:
   - **Bartenders**: 2-3 per bar for service and garnishing.
   - **Support Staff**: 1-2 for restocking and ice management.
   - **Runners**: Dedicated to transporting supplies between central storage and bars.

### Batching Plan

1. **Pre-Batching Cocktails**:
   - Select 3â€“4 high-volume cocktails that share ingredients to streamline prep.
   - **Examples**: A Gin & Tonic, Rum Punch, and a Whiskey Lemonade. These can be kegged or bottled in advance.
   - **Batch Size**: Prepare in large volumes (e.g., 5-gallon batches) for each cocktail, stored in insulated containers.

2. **Batching Math**:
   - Calculate based on expected peak service time (usually around 3 hours).
   - Assume 3 drinks per person on average, equating to 6,000 drinks total.

3. **Storage & Labeling**:
   - Clearly label each batch with cocktail name, ingredients, and date/time of batching.
   - Store in a cool area away from direct sunlight to maintain quality.

### Contingency Plans

1. **Power & Ice Backup**:
   - Have backup generators or manual tools (e.g., hand-cranked blenders) for power outages.
   - Partner with a local supplier for emergency ice delivery if needed.

2. **Staff Shortages**:
   - Have a reserve list of on-call staff to fill in if any scheduled staff are unavailable.

3. **Glassware Shortages**:
   - Stock extra disposable cups and encourage guests to reuse them to minimize waste.

### Summary Checklist

- Finalize menu and batch recipes 48 hours in advance.
- Set up stations with clear roles and responsibilities for each staff member.
- Conduct a 15-minute pre-shift briefing to ensure all staff are aligned.
- Ensure all equipment and supplies are in place 2 hours before the event start.
- Implement a feedback loop post-event to improve future operations.

This plan should help maintain a smooth operation throughout the festival, ensuring guests enjoy their drinks with minimal wait times.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Flow Management**: Include strategies for managing guest flow and line management to prevent overcrowding at bars.
  - **Menu Adaptability**: Offer a plan for adjusting the menu based on real-time demand and inventory levels.
  - **Waste Management**: Detail a plan for managing waste and recycling, especially for high-volume events.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Batching Complexity**: Simplify batching by focusing on fewer cocktail options to ensure quality and reduce complexity.
  - **Staffing Assumptions**: Avoid assuming a fixed number of staff; provide a flexible staffing model based on real-time attendance and demand.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Real-Time Inventory Tracking**: Implement a system for real-time inventory tracking to prevent shortages and overstock.
  - **Communication Protocols**: Establish clear communication protocols for staff to address issues quickly and efficiently.
  - **Feedback Mechanism**: Develop a structured feedback mechanism for guests and staff to capture insights immediately post-event.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, particularly in the contingency section.
  - **Prioritization**: Highlight critical tasks and prioritize actions to ensure focus on high-impact areas.
  - **Clarity**: Use straightforward language and avoid jargon to ensure all staff can easily understand and execute the plan.
