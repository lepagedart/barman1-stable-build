Prompt: What’s a low-cost but memorable wow factor cocktail or service moment that fits the intimate space?

Lloyd's Response:

For an intimate space, you want a cocktail or service moment that feels personal and engaging without overwhelming the small setting. Here’s a suggestion:

**Smoke & Spice Old Fashioned**

**Spec:**
- 2 oz Bourbon (select a cost-effective, flavorful brand)
- 0.25 oz Spiced Syrup (cinnamon, clove, and a hint of chili)
- 3 dashes Angostura bitters

**Ice / Glass / Garnish:**
- Large ice cube / Rocks glass / Orange peel

**Method:**
1. Combine bourbon, spiced syrup, and bitters in a mixing glass.
2. Stir with ice until well-chilled.
3. Strain over a large ice cube in a rocks glass.
4. Express an orange peel over the drink, then garnish with it.

**Cost Notes:**
- Target a pour cost of around 18-20%. The spiced syrup can be made in-house to keep costs low and reused in other cocktails.

**Service Notes:**
- Consider a smoke presentation: capture smoke under a cloche with the drink, removing it tableside for a dramatic reveal. Use wood chips like apple or cherry for a pleasant aroma.
- Spiced syrup can be batched and stored for up to a week.

**Rationale:**
This cocktail combines a classic with a twist, enhancing the guest experience with a simple yet effective smoke reveal. It’s memorable and fits the intimate setting by engaging guests with a sensory experience that doesn’t require loud or flashy elements. The homemade syrup keeps costs down while adding a unique touch.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context:** Clearly define the venue’s theme, clientele, and existing beverage program to ensure the cocktail aligns with the overall concept.
  - **Guest Experience:** Include specific guest interaction strategies or staff training tips to enhance the personal touch in service.
  - **Allergy Considerations:** Address potential allergens in the spiced syrup and suggest alternatives or precautions.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Smoke Presentation:** While engaging, the smoke reveal can be logistically challenging in a small space. Suggest simpler alternatives or ensure the venue can support this feature without disrupting service flow.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Batching Protocol:** Provide detailed instructions on batching and storing the spiced syrup, including measurements, storage conditions, and labeling practices.
  - **Cost Management:** Offer a breakdown of ingredient costs and potential suppliers to ensure the target pour cost is realistic and achievable.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Streamline the cocktail description and preparation steps to focus on key details, avoiding overly descriptive language.
  - **Professional Language:** Use precise, industry-standard terminology to maintain professionalism and clarity.
  - **Engagement Tips:** Offer specific phrases or actions for staff to use when presenting the cocktail to enhance guest interaction.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can provide a more comprehensive, feasible, and engaging cocktail program tailored to the venue's unique setting.
