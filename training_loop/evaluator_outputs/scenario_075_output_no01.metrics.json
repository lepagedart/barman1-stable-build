  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for the event. The feasibility is high with clear roles and inventory calculations. Clarity could be improved by simplifying some sections and avoiding jargon. The structure is mostly effective, though a summary table for inventory could enhance quick reference. Actionability is strong, with clear steps and contingency plans. Alignment with the prompt is good, though additional focus on guest flow management and feedback mechanisms would be beneficial.",
