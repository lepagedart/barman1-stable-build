  "notes": "The response is clear and well-structured, providing a concise menu and operational suggestions. However, it lacks specific alignment with the caf\u00e9's current context and customer base. Feasibility is moderate due to assumptions about staff capabilities and ingredient availability. Actionability could be improved with more detailed steps for implementation and feedback mechanisms.",
