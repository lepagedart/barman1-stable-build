  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan to address the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and align with the goal of improving guest experience. However, the response could benefit from more specific context about the venue and a more concise tone. Additionally, integrating digital solutions for recipe access and feedback could enhance the feasibility and modernity of the approach.",
