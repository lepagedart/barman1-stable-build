  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear cocktail recipes with detailed preparation and cost notes. The response aligns with the venue's high-touch, chef-driven approach. However, it lacks specific venue context and distributor relationship details, which could enhance alignment and feasibility. The suggestions for improvement in 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' are relevant and actionable, but the initial response could have been more precise in addressing these areas.",
