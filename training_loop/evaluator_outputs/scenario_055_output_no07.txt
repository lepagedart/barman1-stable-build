Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights**: Include metrics or case studies to support the effectiveness of waste-reduction strategies.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for ongoing feedback from bartenders to refine processes.
  - **Technology Integration**: Suggest using inventory management software to track ingredient usage and waste.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumptions on Staff Training**: Avoid assuming all staff will adapt quickly; propose a phased training approach.
  - **Generalization on Ingredient Use**: Recognize that not all venues can use the same ingredients across different cocktails due to menu diversity.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)**: Develop detailed SOPs for each strategy, ensuring consistency in implementation.
  - **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic audits to assess the effectiveness of waste-reduction measures and adjust as necessary.
  - **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Encourage collaboration between kitchen and bar staff for shared ingredient use.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Specificity**: Use clear, specific language to outline each strategy, avoiding jargon.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Frame suggestions as actionable steps, e.g., "Implement a system for..."
  - **Structured Format**: Use numbered lists for strategies to enhance readability and follow a logical order from preparation to execution.
