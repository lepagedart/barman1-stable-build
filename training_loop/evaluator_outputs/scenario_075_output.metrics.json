  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for the event. It includes detailed roles, inventory calculations, and contingency plans, which are feasible and actionable. However, it could benefit from more concise language and a focus on essential tasks to improve clarity. The addition of guest flow management and signage is a good suggestion for alignment with event needs.",
