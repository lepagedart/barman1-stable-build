  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a feasible plan for serving drinks efficiently. The clarity is good, but could be improved with more concise bullet points. The plan is actionable with clear roles and tasks, though it could benefit from more venue-specific details. Alignment with the prompt is strong, but further customization for different venues would enhance the response.",
