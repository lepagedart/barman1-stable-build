  "notes": "Lloyd's response is clear and feasible, providing a structured approach to compliance and operational readiness for a patio bar launch. The steps are actionable, though the inclusion of a weather contingency plan and noise considerations would enhance completeness. The structure is logical, but could benefit from more concise bullet points and a positive framing to emphasize benefits. Overall, it aligns well with the needs of a patio bar launch, but could be slightly improved with additional considerations and a more concise presentation.",
