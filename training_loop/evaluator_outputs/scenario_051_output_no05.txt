Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize local, low-waste sourcing and sustainable packaging.

Venue Context: A coastal restaurant group wants its fall menu launch to highlight eco-conscious practices.

Prompt: How should we design a fall cocktail menu that balances sustainability with guest excitement, while keeping costs in check?

Lloyd's Response:

To design a fall cocktail menu that balances sustainability with guest excitement while keeping costs in check, focus on ingredient synergy, seasonal selections, and efficient operations. Here’s how to achieve this:

### Sustainable Ingredient Choices
- **Seasonal and Local**: Use fall ingredients like apples, pears, cranberries, and pumpkins. These are cost-effective, reduce environmental impact, and resonate with the fall theme.
- **Cross-Utilization**: Leverage ingredients across multiple cocktails. For example, use apple cider as a mixer in one drink and a syrup base in another.
- **Full-Utilization**: Maximize ingredient use by employing peels for garnishes or syrups, and leftover pulp for infusions.

### Exciting Guest Experience
- **Thematic Cocktails**: Create drinks that tell a story or highlight a fall theme. Consider a spiced pear sour or a smoky maple old fashioned.
- **Visual Appeal**: Use sustainable garnishes, like dehydrated citrus wheels or edible flowers, which can be made in-house and stored for longer periods.

### Cost Management
- **Batching**: Pre-batch components like syrups or infusions to reduce prep time and waste. This ensures consistency and speeds up service.
- **Portion Control**: Review pour sizes to meet target margins, ensuring that any reduction doesn’t compromise the drink’s perceived value.
- **Menu Design**: Feature a mix of high-margin classics and innovative offerings. Highlight a few cocktails with premium ingredients to anchor the menu price range without overwhelming costs.

### Operational Efficiency
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on the sustainable story behind each drink to enhance upselling and guest engagement.
- **Waste Tracking**: Implement a system to measure and reduce waste, such as tracking unused garnishes or excess drink mix.

### Sample Fall Cocktail
**Spiced Pear Sour**
- Spec: 1.5 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz spiced pear syrup, 0.5 oz lemon juice, 0.25 oz simple syrup
- Ice / Glass / Garnish: Served on the rocks in a rocks glass with a dehydrated pear slice
- Method: Shake with ice, strain over fresh ice
- Cost Notes: Target pour cost ≤22%; use house-made spiced pear syrup to control costs
- Rationale: Combines fall flavors in a guest-pleasing sour format, utilizing easily sourced ingredients.

By focusing on these strategies, you can craft a fall cocktail menu that delights guests, supports sustainability, and maintains profitability.
