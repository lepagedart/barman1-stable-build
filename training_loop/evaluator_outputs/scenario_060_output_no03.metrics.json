  "notes": "Lloyd's response is generally feasible and provides a solid foundation for a pop-up bar service plan. However, it lacks clarity in some areas due to overly detailed descriptions, such as specific inch measurements, which may overwhelm the client. The structure could be improved with more concise bullet points and prioritization of tasks. Actionability is moderate, as the plan includes practical steps but misses elements like customer engagement and staff training. Alignment with client needs could be enhanced by addressing health and safety protocols and simplifying backup plans.",
