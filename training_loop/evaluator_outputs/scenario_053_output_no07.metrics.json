  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable steps for optimizing poolside bar stations. The use of sections and bullet points enhances readability. However, it could benefit from including guest experience metrics and training protocols. Simplifying some instructions and offering customizable options for different venues would improve feasibility. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be slightly more concise and focused on essentials.",
