Title: Hotel Pool Bar High-Volume Afternoon

Tags: event_setup, workflow, speed_of_service, batching, guest_experience

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize throughput, heat/ice constraints, and drink durability. Avoid fussy builds—opt for scalable recipes and garnish discipline.

Venue Context: Resort pool bar serving 200 guests in afternoon peak. Hot weather, limited cold storage, and a single ice machine shared with banquets.

Prompt: Our pool bar melts down every weekend when 200+ guests hit at once. Drinks take forever, ice runs out, and garnishes spoil. How do we fix menu and setup so service flies and drinks hold up in the heat?

Lloyd's Response:

To address the bottlenecks at your pool bar and ensure smooth service during peak times, consider the following strategies:

### Menu Simplification and Optimization
1. **Focus on Highball and Spritz Cocktails**:
   - Prioritize easy-to-make, refreshing drinks like spritzes and highballs that require minimal ingredients and steps.
   - Example: Aperol Spritz (3 oz Prosecco, 2 oz Aperol, splash of soda) served in a wine glass with ice and an orange slice.

2. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch popular cocktails such as Margaritas or Mojitos. Keep them in chillers or dispense from tap systems if available.
   - Pre-batched **Margarita Spec**: 1 part tequila, 1 part lime juice, 0.5 part triple sec. Serve over ice with a lime wedge.

### Operational Adjustments
1. **Ice Management**:
   - Reduce ice usage by using larger cubes or spheres in cocktails, which melt slower.
   - Implement a strict ice allocation per shift and ensure ice bins are well-insulated.

2. **Garnish Discipline**:
   - Limit garnishes to those that are heat-resistant and simple, such as citrus wheels or mint sprigs.
   - Pre-slice and store garnishes in chilled containers to maintain freshness.

3. **Workstation Layout**:
   - Streamline stations with a clear FIFO (first in, first out) process: Glass → Ice → Spirit → Modifier → Garnish.
   - Ensure all tools and ingredients are within arm’s reach to minimize movement.

### Action Checklist
- **Batch** key cocktails ahead of time and equip staff with a batching log to track usage and shelf life.
- **Optimize** ice usage by training staff on efficient ice management practices.
- **Arrange** garnishes and tools for quick access and minimal movement.
- **Test** workflow with a mock service drill during a quiet period to identify any bottlenecks.
- **Monitor** service speed and adjust staffing or processes as needed during peak hours.

These strategic adjustments will help you maintain fast service, reduce ice dependency, and keep drinks fresh and appealing in the heat.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Staff Training:** Include a section on training staff specifically on new processes, such as batching and ice management, to ensure smooth implementation.
  - **Customer Feedback Loop:** Suggest a system for gathering customer feedback on new menu items and service speed to continuously improve offerings.
  - **Inventory Management:** Address inventory tracking for pre-batched cocktails to prevent waste and ensure consistent quality.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Pre-Batching Complexity:** Avoid suggesting pre-batching for cocktails that require fresh ingredients (e.g., Mojitos with fresh mint) unless a clear preservation method is provided.
  - **Ice Management Specificity:** The suggestion to use larger ice cubes might not be feasible for all venues; recommend assessing current ice capabilities first.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Develop detailed SOPs for batching, ice management, and workstation layout to ensure consistency and efficiency.
  - **Technology Utilization:** Recommend using POS systems to track popular drinks and adjust pre-batching quantities accordingly.
  - **Regular Review Meetings:** Implement regular meetings to review service efficiency and make necessary adjustments based on staff feedback.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each strategy to enhance readability and quick reference during busy service times.
  - **Prioritization:** Clearly prioritize actions based on impact and ease of implementation to guide venue management in decision-making.
  - **Empathy and Support:** Use a supportive tone that acknowledges the challenges of peak service times and offers solutions as collaborative improvements rather than mandates.
