Title: Pop-Up Wedding Bar: Throughput With Minimal Power/Ice

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, workflow, speed_of_service, layout_flow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Activate Event Setup Lens + Layout Lens. Provide station maps (ASCII ok), throughput targets (drinks/min), batching math, ice/mixer cadence, contingency plans, and a 15-min pre-shift brief.

Venue Context: Farm venue with limited power, 250 guests, two 6-foot folding bars, 3 bartenders, no back-of-house ice machine. 90-minute peak right after ceremony.

Prompt: Design the full pop-up service plan to keep lines short and quality high—menu design, batching, layout, staffing roles, and backup plans for ice/power hiccups.

Lloyd's Response:

Here's a comprehensive service plan to ensure your pop-up bar operates efficiently, even during peak times, while maintaining high-quality cocktails and minimizing wait times.

### Menu Design
- **Streamlined Selection**: Limit the menu to 5–6 cocktails focusing on simplicity and speed. Choose drinks that share ingredients to minimize prep time and SKU load.
- **Drink Types**: Include highballs, spritzes, and spirit-forward drinks that don't require shaking.
- **Cross-Utilized Ingredients**: Use versatile syrups and infusions applicable to multiple drinks, like a citrus syrup that works in both a gin highball and a vodka spritz.

### Batching
- **Pre-Batched Cocktails**: Batch spirit-only cocktails like Negronis or Old Fashioneds. Store in secure containers with spouts for quick service.
- **Shelf Life**: Ensure batched cocktails are stored in coolers to maintain freshness, with a shelf life of 2–3 days.
- **Ice-Resilient Options**: Offer at least one cocktail that can be served over crushed ice or with minimal dilution, like a Tiki-style punch.

### Layout
- **Station Map**: 
  - Designate separate areas for order-taking, drink assembly, and pickup to streamline the workflow.
  - Use a U-shaped bar layout to minimize bartender movement and facilitate faster service.
- **Reach Zones**:
  - **Zone A (0–18")**: Place jiggers, frequently used spirits, and tools within immediate reach.
  - **Zone B (18–30")**: Store secondary ingredients and backup glassware.
  - **Zone C (>30")**: Keep bulk supplies, backup ice, and items for restock.

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartender 1**: Dedicated to batching and restocking, ensuring there's always a supply of pre-batched cocktails ready.
- **Bartender 2**: Focuses on assembly and serving of drinks, maximizing speed and efficiency.
- **Support Staff**: One runner responsible for handling orders and delivering drinks to guests, minimizing congestion at the bar.

### Backup Plans
- **Ice Management**: 
  - Use insulated bins to store backup ice and reduce melt.
  - Have a contingency plan for additional ice delivery if needed.
- **Power Hiccups**: 
  - Ensure all batched cocktails and perishable items are stored in coolers with ice packs.
  - Keep a manual shaker and hand crank ice crusher as fallback options.

### Summary Checklist
1. Finalize the streamlined menu and ensure ingredient cross-utilization.
2. Batch cocktails in advance and store securely.
3. Arrange bar layout for efficient service with designated reach zones.
4. Assign clear roles to staff to enhance operational flow.
5. Implement backup measures for ice and power interruptions.

By following this plan, your pop-up bar can maintain high service quality and efficiency, even under challenging conditions.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Customer Experience:** Include strategies for engaging with customers, such as personalized service tips or interactive elements to enhance the pop-up experience.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system for collecting customer feedback to refine operations in real-time.
  - **Health and Safety Protocols:** Address sanitation and safety measures, especially in high-traffic environments.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Complexity of Roles:** Simplify staffing roles; the current setup may be too rigid for a pop-up context. Consider cross-training staff to adapt to varying demands.
  - **Backup Plans:** The power backup plan is overly detailed for a pop-up. Focus on essentials, like ensuring critical items are covered without over-preparation.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Introduce a digital inventory system to track ingredient usage and prevent shortages.
  - **Training Program:** Develop a concise training module for staff to quickly adapt to the pop-up's unique service model.
  - **Real-Time Adjustments:** Set up a communication system for staff to report issues and adapt the service plan on the fly.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Brevity:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Focus on imperative verbs to drive action, e.g., "Implement," "Ensure," "Designate."
  - **Consistent Format:** Maintain uniformity in section headings and sub-points for a professional presentation.
