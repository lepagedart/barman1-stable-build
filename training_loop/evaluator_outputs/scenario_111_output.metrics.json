  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for a standardized bar program. It balances consistency with local character and includes detailed steps for implementation. However, it could benefit from more concise language and a clearer emphasis on sustainability and local market research. The feedback loop and SOPs are good suggestions for improvement. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor adjustments.",
