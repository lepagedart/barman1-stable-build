  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for creating a sustainable and exciting fall cocktail menu. The use of bullet points enhances clarity, and the suggestions are feasible for most venues. However, the response could benefit from a brief market analysis and a system for guest feedback to ensure the menu remains competitive and appealing. Additionally, simplifying ingredient suggestions could increase applicability across different venues.",
