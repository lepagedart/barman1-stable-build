  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable strategies for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and facilitates quick reference. The response aligns well with the prompt, focusing on efficiency and synergy between the bar and kitchen. However, it could benefit from a stronger emphasis on guest engagement and a more explicit feedback mechanism. Additionally, while the response assumes a certain level of capability in venues, it could be more cautious about the complexity of techniques suggested.",
