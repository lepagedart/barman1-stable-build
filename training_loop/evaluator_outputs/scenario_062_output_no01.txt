Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Sustainability Lens

Venue Context: A mid-size hotel is moving to eliminate single-use plastic straws but is worried about guest complaints.

Prompt: How should we structure a straw policy that balances sustainability goals with guest expectations and accessibility needs?

Lloyd's Response:

To craft a straw policy that aligns sustainability goals with guest expectations and accessibility needs, follow these steps:

### Policy Structure

1. **Default No-Straw Policy**
   - Implement a default policy of not automatically providing straws with drinks. Train staff to offer straws only upon request to minimize usage.

2. **Sustainable Straw Options**
   - Stock sustainable alternatives such as paper, metal, or biodegradable straws. Ensure that these options are easily accessible for staff when requested by guests.

3. **Accessibility Considerations**
   - Maintain a supply of plastic straws for guests with accessibility needs. Clearly communicate this option to guests and staff to ensure that those who require them can access them easily.

4. **Guest Communication**
   - Use signage and menu notes to inform guests of your sustainability initiative and straw policy. Highlight that straws are available upon request and that options exist for those with specific needs.

5. **Staff Training**
   - Train staff to understand the policy, including the importance of sustainability and the need for accessibility. Equip them with scripts to explain the policy to guests politely and informatively.

### Implementation Checklist

- [ ] Remove straws from default setups and provide only upon request.
- [ ] Stock a mix of paper, metal, and biodegradable straws for regular use.
- [ ] Keep plastic straws discreetly available for accessibility needs.
- [ ] Create and display signage explaining the straw policy.
- [ ] Train staff on policy details, guest communication, and accessibility support.

By structuring your straw policy in this way, you align with sustainability goals while respecting all guests' needs, ensuring an inclusive and environmentally conscious service experience.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights:** Include data or case studies on the impact of straw policies in similar venues to support the proposed changes.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a process for collecting guest feedback on the straw policy to continuously improve and adapt.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumptions on Guest Needs:** Avoid assuming all guests will understand or appreciate the policy without proper context or education. Ensure explanations are clear and considerate.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a tracking system for straw usage to monitor the effectiveness of the policy and adjust inventory accordingly.
  - **Accessibility Protocol:** Develop a clear protocol for staff to discreetly offer plastic straws to guests with accessibility needs, ensuring dignity and privacy.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Precision:** Use bullet points for each policy step to enhance readability and ensure clarity.
  - **Empathy and Inclusivity:** Adopt a tone that emphasizes empathy, particularly in communications about accessibility options, to ensure all guests feel respected and valued.
  - **Consistency in Messaging:** Ensure that all guest-facing communications, including signage and menu notes, use consistent language to avoid confusion.

- **Conciseness and Focus:**
  - **Eliminate Redundancies:** Streamline the policy explanation to focus on key actions and benefits, avoiding repetitive statements.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use direct, action-oriented language to clearly outline steps and expectations for staff and guests.
