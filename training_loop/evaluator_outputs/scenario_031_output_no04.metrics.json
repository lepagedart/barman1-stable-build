  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for optimizing bar operations with two bartenders. The use of sections and bullet points enhances clarity, though consistency in bullet point usage could be improved. The feasibility of the throughput target may need adjustment based on drink complexity, and the inclusion of staff training and feedback mechanisms would strengthen the plan. Overall, the response is actionable and aligns well with the goal of improving efficiency during peak times.",
