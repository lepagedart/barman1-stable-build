Title: Speed-Well Redesign for Two-Bartender Service

Tags: layout_flow, prep_efficiency, speed, service_well, menu_design

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize station ergonomics, rail loadout, reach zones, and build-path sequencing. Include a 15-minute peak stress drill with throughput targets.

Venue Context: 80-seat neighborhood restaurant; bar has 10 stools and a single service well. Friday/Saturday peaks with two bartenders on, one focused on service well tickets.

Prompt: Our service well gets crushed on weekends. Can you redesign the well layout and build flow so two bartenders can run without collisions and keep ticket times under five minutes?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your service well for efficient operation with two bartenders during peak times, focus on minimizing movement, preventing collisions, and ensuring a streamlined build flow. Here's a practical approach:

### Station Map
- **Role Designation**: Assign one bartender to the service well for server tickets and the other to the guest-facing well to handle direct customers. This separation helps reduce the need for crossover and potential collisions.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Implement a one-way flow behind the bar to avoid collisions. Depending on your layout, choose a left-to-right or right-to-left movement pattern. Mark lanes with floor tape if needed for clarity.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Keep frequently used items like jiggers, strainers, and bitters within immediate reach.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Place less frequently used bottles and tools here. This zone is ideal for spirits used in multiple cocktails.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Store backup supplies and less-used bottles outside of immediate reach to avoid clutter.

### Rail Loadout
- **Bottle Order**: Arrange bottles from left to right based on usage frequency and type. Consider grouping similar categories together (e.g., vodka, gin, rum).
- **Tool Placement**: Position jiggers, shakers, and strainers in a central location within Zone A for easy access.

### Build Path
- **Sequence**: Follow a consistent build order: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → shake/stir → strain → garnish.
- **Efficiency**: Use a two-bottle pour technique where possible to save time on builds.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set clear pars for ice, citrus, and syrups. Ensure these are prepped and restocked during slower periods.
- **Labeling**: Use clear labels for syrups and juices to prevent confusion and speed up service.

### Collision Controls
- **POS Placement**: Ensure the POS system is easily accessible without crossing paths. Consider a second terminal if space allows.
- **Pass Line**: Establish a designated pass line for drinks to be picked up by servers, reducing the need for bartenders to move around.

### KPIs & Stress Test
- **Throughput Target**: Aim for 12–15 tickets per minute during peak times.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 15-minute drill before peak hours to identify bottlenecks and adjust as needed.

### Summary Checklist
1. Assign and clarify bartender roles.
2. Mark traffic lanes and ensure one-way movement.
3. Set up reach zones and rail loadout for optimal efficiency.
4. Establish a consistent build path and train staff on it.
5. Conduct a pre-service drill to test and refine the setup.

Implementing these changes should help streamline your service well operations, reduce collisions, and keep ticket times under five minutes.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context**: Provide specific details about the venue size, layout, and typical customer flow to tailor the advice more precisely.
  - **Staffing Levels**: Mention the total number of staff available during peak times, including support roles like barbacks.
  - **Customer Demographics**: Consider customer preferences that might influence drink choices and service style.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Throughput Target**: 12–15 tickets per minute is unrealistic for two bartenders. Adjust expectations based on venue capacity and complexity of drinks.
  - **Mock Service Drill**: While beneficial, a 15-minute drill might not be feasible daily. Suggest periodic drills or during staff training sessions.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Digital Inventory System**: Recommend using a digital system for tracking inventory and pars to ensure real-time updates and reduce manual errors.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Implement a system for bartenders to provide feedback on the setup and suggest improvements post-shift.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Actionable Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly direct actions (e.g., "Assign," "Implement," "Conduct").
  - **Prioritization**: Highlight the most critical steps in each section to focus efforts effectively.

- **Additional Recommendations:**
  - **Training**: Emphasize the importance of regular training sessions to ensure all staff are familiar with the setup and can execute efficiently.
  - **Customer Interaction**: Include guidelines for maintaining high-quality customer interactions even during peak times to enhance the guest experience.
