  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving cocktail program profitability. The suggestions are clear and feasible, focusing on ingredient optimization, batching, and menu adjustments. However, it could benefit from incorporating guest feedback mechanisms and sustainability practices. The response aligns well with the goal of maintaining guest satisfaction while improving margins, but should consider potential risks of ingredient substitutions on brand perception.",
