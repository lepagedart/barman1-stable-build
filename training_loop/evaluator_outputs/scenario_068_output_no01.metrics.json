  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key aspects of managing a bar at a festival. It provides clear instructions on workflow, batching, and contingency plans. However, it could benefit from more emphasis on guest flow management and waste management strategies. The response is mostly actionable and aligns with the needs of a festival setting, but could be improved with more concise language and prioritization of tasks.",
