  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a feasible cocktail menu strategy. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from more specific venue context and customer feedback integration. The response aligns well with the gastropub's needs but could improve in clarity by simplifying training narratives and focusing on key selling points.",
