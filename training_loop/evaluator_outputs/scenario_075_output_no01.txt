Tags: event_setup, layout, speed_of_service, staffing, throughput

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Combine event setup + layout lenses: quick-serve stations, glassware flow, ice/mixer totals, and contingency plans.

Venue Context: Hotel courtyard pop-up for a summer launch event. Expect 350 guests in 90 minutes; two bars plus one roving tray team.

Prompt: Design a pop-up service to move 350 guests through Champagne and two spritz SKUs in 90 minutes. Provide station maps, staffing roles, par levels, ice/mixer math, tray runs, and a 20-minute peak drill. Keep lines under 4 minutes.

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently serve 350 guests with Champagne and two spritz cocktails in 90 minutes, a well-organized pop-up service plan is crucial. Here's a detailed strategy to keep lines moving and ensure a premium guest experience.

### Station Setup
- **Bar Layout**: Two main service bars, each 6-feet long, positioned centrally to the guest flow.
- **Station Map**:
  ```
  | Ice Bin | Champagne | Spritz 1 | Spritz 2 | Garnishes | POS |
  ```

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartenders (4 total)**:
  - **2 Champagne Pourers**: Dedicated to quickly popping bottles and pouring Champagne.
  - **2 Spritz Makers**: Focused on mixing and serving the two spritz cocktails.
- **1 Runner**: Handles restocking of Champagne, mixers, and ice; assists with tray runs.
- **1 Support Staff**: Manages glassware collection and cleaning.

### Par Levels and Inventory
- **Champagne**: Estimate 1.5 glasses per guest. For 350 guests, prepare 525 glasses. Depending on bottle size, calculate total bottles needed (e.g., approximately 105 bottles for 750ml size).
- **Spritz Ingredients**: 
  - **Spritz 1 & 2**: Pre-batch each spritz for easy pouring. Mix enough for roughly 1 drink per person per SKU.
  - **Garnishes**: Lemon wheels, orange slices, or herbs depending on the spritz recipes.
- **Ice**: Calculate based on spritz needs, approximately 1 pound per drink plus reserves.
- **Mixers**: Batches should include any soda or tonic needed for spritzes.

### Ice and Mixer Math
- **Ice**: Ensure a minimum of 350 pounds of ice, with an additional 100 pounds reserve.
- **Mixer**: Confirm quantities align with recipe batching, allowing for slight over-prep to prevent shortages.

### Tray Runs
- **Trays**: Use for circulating Champagne and spritzes during peak times. Each tray holds 8-10 drinks.
- **Runner Tasks**: Refill trays every 5 minutes; coordinate with bartenders to ensure constant availability.

### 20-Minute Peak Drill
1. **Pre-Shift Huddle**: Brief staff on roles and expectations. Emphasize speed and efficiency.
2. **Mock Service**: Conduct a 20-minute drill with staff serving each other to simulate peak conditions.
3. **Review & Adjust**: Post-drill, discuss bottlenecks and adjust station setups accordingly.
4. **Final Prep**: Confirm all stations are restocked and ready.
5. **Go Live**: Start service with all stations fully operational and staffed.

### Contingency Plans
- **Glassware**: Keep extra stock available; assign a staff member to monitor and replenish.
- **Ice/Power Issues**: Have backup ice stored in coolers; use manual methods if electrical equipment fails.
- **Staffing**: Cross-train staff to cover roles in case of absenteeism.

This plan should keep lines moving efficiently and ensure guests enjoy their drinks with minimal wait times.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Flow Management**: Include strategies for managing guest flow to prevent bottlenecks at the bar. Consider signage or floor markings to guide guests.
  - **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a system for real-time feedback from staff during service to quickly address any issues.
  - **Post-Event Review**: Plan for a debrief session to evaluate the success of the service and identify areas for improvement.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Detailed Inventory Calculations**: Simplify inventory calculations for clarity. Provide a summary table for quick reference.
  - **Excessive Staffing Roles**: Re-evaluate the necessity of all roles. Consider combining roles where feasible to optimize staff usage.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Technology Integration**: Use a digital POS system to track inventory in real-time and streamline transactions.
  - **Pre-Batching**: Emphasize the importance of pre-batching cocktails to reduce service time and maintain consistency.
  - **Training Protocols**: Develop a standardized training manual for staff to ensure consistency in service and role understanding.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for key actions and responsibilities to enhance readability.
  - **Clarity**: Avoid jargon. Use clear, straightforward language to ensure all staff understand their roles and the plan.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs to direct staff actions clearly (e.g., "Prepare," "Ensure," "Conduct").

- **Additional Considerations**:
  - **Sustainability**: Consider eco-friendly options for glassware and garnishes to align with sustainable practices.
  - **Guest Experience**: Include a brief section on enhancing guest interaction, such as staff training on hospitality and engagement.
