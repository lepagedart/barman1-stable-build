  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and feasible, focusing on batching and simplicity for a winter-themed cocktail menu. Clarity could be improved with more bullet points for quick reference. The response aligns well with the prompt but could benefit from including customer insights and sustainability practices. Actionability is strong, though a bit more detail on inventory management and quality control would enhance it.",
