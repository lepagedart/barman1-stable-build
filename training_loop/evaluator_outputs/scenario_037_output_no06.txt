Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on pop-up ergonomics, batching math, and guest throughput targets. Build in contingency plans for glassware, mixers, and staffing.

Venue Context: Corporate holiday party with 500 guests at a rented loft. Temporary bar, limited back-of-house support, one shot at execution.

Prompt: We’re setting up a one-night bar for a corporate holiday event with 500 people. We need a plan that keeps lines down, feels premium, and avoids massive waste at the end. How do we design the menu, batching, and staffing flow?

Lloyd's Response:

For a corporate holiday event serving 500 guests, efficiency and premium service are key. Here's a streamlined plan focusing on menu design, batching, and staffing flow to ensure smooth service without excess waste.

### Menu Design
- **Limited Selection**: Choose 3–4 signature cocktails that balance classic appeal and ease of batching.
  - **Signature Cocktail**: A festive take on a classic, such as a Cranberry Moscow Mule.
  - **Whiskey-Based Option**: Consider a simple Old Fashioned or a Whiskey Sour.
  - **Sparkling Option**: A Champagne cocktail, like a Kir Royale, for a festive touch.
  - **Non-Alcoholic Option**: Offer a mocktail like a Ginger Lemon Fizz.

### Batching Strategy
- **Pre-Batch Cocktails**: Prepare liquor-only batches for each cocktail to streamline service.
  - **Shelf Life**: Ensure pre-batched cocktails are used within 24-48 hours for optimal freshness.
  - **Storage**: Use large dispensers or pitchers for quick access and refills.
- **Glassware**: Use uniform glassware to simplify service and avoid shortages.

### Staffing Flow
- **Bar Setup**: Establish multiple stations to reduce wait times.
  - **Station 1**: Highball and Sparkling Cocktails.
  - **Station 2**: Whiskey and Signature Cocktails.
  - **Station 3**: Non-Alcoholic and Beer/Wine.
- **Staffing**: Allocate 1 bartender per 75-100 guests, with additional support staff for glassware and restocking.
- **Service Flow**: Implement a one-way traffic pattern to minimize congestion and ensure smooth guest flow.

### Operational Notes
- **Prep Time**: Allocate 2-3 hours for batching, setup, and staff briefing before the event.
- **Waste Management**: Use jiggers for precise pours to control liquor usage and minimize waste.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 20-minute run-through before guests arrive to identify potential bottlenecks.

### Action Checklist
1. Finalize and test cocktail recipes for batching.
2. Coordinate staff roles and conduct a pre-event briefing.
3. Set up bar stations with clear signage and access to pre-batched cocktails.
4. Execute a mock service to ensure preparedness.
5. Implement precise inventory tracking to monitor consumption and prevent shortages.

By focusing on a limited, crowd-pleasing menu and optimizing your batching and staffing strategy, you'll provide a premium experience while maintaining efficiency and minimizing waste.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Guest Preferences:** Include a mechanism to gather guest preferences or dietary restrictions ahead of time to tailor the menu more precisely.
  - **Sustainability Practices:** Address sustainability by suggesting eco-friendly glassware or recycling options.
  - **Contingency Plan:** Outline a backup plan for unexpected issues such as staff shortages or supply delays.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Menu Complexity:** Offering four cocktail options might be too complex for high-volume service. Consider reducing to three to streamline operations further.
  - **Staffing Ratios:** The suggested bartender-to-guest ratio might be insufficient for peak times; recommend a more conservative ratio, such as 1 bartender per 50-75 guests.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a digital inventory system for real-time tracking and alerts for low stock.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a post-event feedback process to gather insights for future improvements.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Clarity:** Clearly separate sections with headers and ensure each point is actionable and specific.
  - **Professional Tone:** Maintain a formal, consultative tone throughout to align with corporate expectations.
