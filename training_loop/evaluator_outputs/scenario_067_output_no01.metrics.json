  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear strategies for reducing waste in a citrus-heavy cocktail program. The suggestions are feasible and actionable, with a good balance of detail and practicality. However, the response could benefit from a cost analysis and more emphasis on staff training. The guest communication section could be more concise, focusing on benefits rather than operational details. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be slightly more concise and prioritized.",
