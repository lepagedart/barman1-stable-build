  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive training plan. It clearly outlines the training session into distinct parts, making it easy to follow. However, it could benefit from more contextual clarity and addressing potential guest objections. The inclusion of a feedback mechanism and digital resources is a good suggestion for ongoing support. The tone could be more engaging to maintain staff interest.",
