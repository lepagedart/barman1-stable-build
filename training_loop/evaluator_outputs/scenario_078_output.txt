Title: Compliance at Scale: Stadium Cocktail Kiosk

Tags: compliance, event_setup, batching, workflow, signage

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use Compliance + Event Setup lenses. Emphasize ID flows, signage, labeling, and documented batch logs.

Venue Context: Stadium concourse kiosk serving 1,200 guests during 30-minute halftime window. Limited back-of-house, canned beer/wine plus two batched cocktails.

Prompt: Design a compliance-forward kiosk playbook: ID check flow, age-band wristbanding, visible signage, allergen labels, batch log template, and a pre-shift compliance checklist. Provide staffing roles for 4 team members and a 30-minute surge plan to hit 240 drinks/half-time with zero compliance flags.

Lloyd's Response:

### Compliance-Forward Kiosk Playbook

**1. ID Check Flow**
   - **Greeter Role**: Position one staff member as the greeter at the kiosk entrance. They are responsible for checking IDs using a UV light scanner for authenticity and issuing age-appropriate wristbands (21+).
   - **Wristband System**: Use color-coded wristbands to identify age groups. Ensure clarity and visibility for staff at all points of service.

**2. Visible Signage**
   - Place clear, prominent signage at the entrance and order points detailing ID check requirements, age restrictions, and allergen information.
   - Include emergency contact information and procedures for guests needing assistance.

**3. Allergen Labels**
   - All menu items should be accompanied by allergen information. Use a standardized label template that includes common allergens (gluten, nuts, dairy, etc.).
   - Ensure batch containers are labeled with detailed ingredient lists and potential allergens.

**4. Batch Log Template**
   - Use a logbook or digital tool to maintain records of all batched cocktails. Include:
     - Batch Name
     - Ingredients & Proportions
     - Date & Time of Preparation
     - Use-By Date
     - Allergen Information
     - Staff Signature

**5. Pre-Shift Compliance Checklist**
   - Verify all signage is visible and up-to-date.
   - Ensure all staff have ID verification tools (UV light, guides).
   - Check wristband supplies and restock as needed.
   - Confirm all allergens are correctly labeled on menu and batch containers.
   - Review batch logs for accuracy and completeness.

### Staffing Roles for 4 Team Members
1. **Greeter/ID Checker**: Positioned at the entrance for age verification and wristbanding.
2. **Bartender 1**: Focus on high-volume cocktail preparation, ensuring compliance with batch protocols.
3. **Bartender 2**: Handles guest interactions, taking orders, and addressing allergen inquiries.
4. **Floater/Support**: Assists with restocking, compliance checks, and guest assistance.

### 30-Minute Surge Plan (240 Drinks/30 Minutes)
- **Batch Ready**: Pre-batch cocktails to cover 80% of expected orders, focusing on bestsellers.
- **Station Efficiency**: Set up two dedicated service lanes to minimize wait times.
- **Role Rotation**: Every 10 minutes, rotate staff roles to maintain energy and focus.
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Use a handheld device for tracking ID checks and allergen queries, ensuring compliance is met in real-time.

### Zero Compliance Flags Strategy
- Conduct a pre-event briefing to ensure all staff are clear on roles and compliance expectations.
- Implement a “two-touch” system for sensitive tasks like allergen disclosure and ID verification, ensuring another team member verifies the action.
- Have a rapid escalation protocol for any compliance issues, with the floater ready to address or escalate issues immediately.

This playbook should keep your kiosk both efficient and compliant, providing a seamless and safe service experience.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Emergency Protocols**: Include a detailed emergency response plan for incidents beyond compliance, such as medical emergencies or security threats.
  - **Training Program**: Outline a training schedule for new and existing staff on compliance, customer service, and emergency protocols.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for collecting and analyzing customer and staff feedback to continuously improve operations.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Role Rotation Frequency**: Rotating roles every 10 minutes may be too frequent and disruptive. Consider extending to 20-30 minutes to maintain efficiency without causing confusion.
  - **Real-Time Monitoring Tools**: Ensure the feasibility and availability of handheld devices for all staff, as this could be resource-intensive.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Digital Signage**: Implement digital signage for easy updates and clear communication of compliance requirements and menu changes.
  - **Automated Alerts**: Use technology to send alerts for low stock on wristbands or other critical supplies.
  - **Compliance Audits**: Schedule regular audits to ensure adherence to compliance protocols and identify areas for improvement.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use concise language and bullet points for easy reference during high-pressure situations.
  - **Positive Reinforcement**: Include positive reinforcement strategies to motivate staff, such as recognition for compliance adherence.
  - **Sequential Logic**: Ensure the playbook follows a logical sequence, from preparation to execution, to facilitate understanding and implementation.
