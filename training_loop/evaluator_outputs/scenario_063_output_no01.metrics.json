  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a structured approach to optimizing bar service under limited power supply, but lacks specific contextual understanding of the venue. Recommendations are generally feasible but could benefit from a cost-benefit analysis, especially regarding portable battery packs. The response is clear but could be improved with more precise bullet points and prioritization of actions. Additional elements like a communication plan and supplier coordination are missing, which would enhance the practicality and comprehensiveness of the advice.",
