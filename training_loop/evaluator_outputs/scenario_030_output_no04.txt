Tags: staff_development, upselling, guest_engagement, training

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on practical upselling tactics, staff scripts, and guest engagement strategies.

Venue Context: Family-style casual dining restaurant with a full bar but staff rarely suggest cocktails or higher-margin items.

Prompt: Our servers and bartenders aren’t upselling cocktails or premium spirits. How can we train staff to upsell without being pushy and improve our check averages?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively train your staff to upsell cocktails and premium spirits without appearing pushy, focus on education, engagement techniques, and goal-setting. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

### Staff Training and Education
- **Product Knowledge:** Ensure your staff understands the flavor profiles, stories, and unique selling points of premium spirits and featured cocktails. Use brief, engaging sessions to cover key points.
- **Tasting Sessions:** Organize regular tastings so staff can personally experience the products they're recommending. This builds confidence and authenticity in their suggestions.

### Engagement Techniques
- **Conversational Upselling:** Train staff to engage guests by asking open-ended questions like, "Are you in the mood for something refreshing or bold?" This approach helps guide the guest's decision without pressure.
- **Storytelling:** Encourage staff to share interesting anecdotes about the cocktail's ingredients or the history of a particular spirit. This creates a narrative that captivates guests.
- **Suggestive Pairing:** Teach staff to suggest cocktail pairings that enhance the dining experience, such as recommending a specific spirit that complements a guest's entrée.

### Setting Goals and Incentives
- **Check Average Targets:** Set realistic targets for check averages and communicate these goals clearly. Provide individual and team incentives for meeting targets, such as bonuses or recognition.
- **Role-Playing Exercises:** Use role-playing sessions where staff practice upselling scenarios. Provide feedback and highlight successful techniques.
- **Regular Feedback:** Hold brief, regular meetings to discuss upselling successes and areas for improvement. Use these sessions to share tips and celebrate achievements.

### Summary Checklist
1. Conduct product knowledge and tasting sessions regularly.
2. Train staff on conversational upselling and storytelling techniques.
3. Set clear check average targets with corresponding incentives.
4. Implement role-playing exercises to practice upselling.
5. Provide ongoing feedback and celebrate upselling successes.

By focusing on these strategies, you can empower your staff to upsell effectively, enhancing guest satisfaction and increasing your venue's check averages.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Address Missing Context:**
  - Identify the venue type, target audience, and current staff skill level to tailor the training program effectively.
  - Clarify if there are any existing upselling challenges or guest feedback that needs addressing.

- **Avoid Overreach:**
  - Do not assume all staff are comfortable with storytelling; provide optional training for those interested.
  - Ensure incentives align with company values and do not pressure staff into aggressive sales tactics.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Implement a feedback loop where staff can share guest reactions to upselling attempts, refining techniques based on real-world interactions.
  - Develop a digital repository of cocktail and spirit information accessible to staff for continuous learning.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Use a more direct and concise structure, focusing on actionable steps rather than broad strategies.
  - Incorporate a section on handling guest objections or disinterest in upselling to prepare staff for various scenarios.

- **Conciseness and Clarity:**
  - Replace lengthy explanations with bullet points for quick reference during training sessions.
  - Ensure each section has a clear objective and measurable outcomes to track progress and success.
