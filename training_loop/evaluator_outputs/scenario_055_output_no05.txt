Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Venue Context**: Provide specific examples or scenarios tailored to the type of venue (e.g., high-volume nightclub vs. craft cocktail bar) to ensure relevance and applicability.
  
- **Overreach in Suggestions**: Avoid assuming all venues have the capability to implement advanced techniques like oleo saccharum. Offer scalable solutions that can be adapted based on venue size and resources.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Introduce a system for tracking ingredient usage and waste to identify patterns and areas for improvement.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism for bartenders to report on the effectiveness of waste-reduction strategies and suggest adjustments.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each strategy to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Actionable Steps**: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions for implementing each strategy, ensuring they are practical and easy to follow.
  - **Supportive Tone**: Encourage a collaborative approach by involving staff in the development and refinement of waste-reduction practices.

- **Additional Considerations**:
  - **Cost-Benefit Analysis**: Suggest conducting an analysis to weigh the cost savings from waste reduction against any potential impact on service speed or quality.
  - **Monitoring and Evaluation**: Recommend regular review sessions to assess the effectiveness of implemented strategies and make necessary adjustments.
