Prompt: Guests have been complaining about inconsistent cocktails and some regulars have stopped coming back. How do we reset standards and repair guest trust?

Lloyd's Response:

To address guests' complaints about inconsistent cocktails and work on regaining their trust, you should focus on standardizing your cocktail preparation and enhancing the overall guest experience. Here’s a step-by-step plan to help reset standards and repair guest trust:

### Standardization and Training

1. **Develop Standardized Recipes**
   - Create detailed recipes for each cocktail with exact measurements, specified glassware, ice type, and garnish instructions.
   - Use visual aids like recipe cards or posters at each station to reinforce these standards.

2. **Conduct Training Sessions**
   - Organize training sessions to walk through each cocktail, emphasizing discrepancies in technique like shaking strength, garnish application, and presentation.
   - Encourage staff to practice consistently following recipes until they are second nature.

3. **Implement Quality Checks**
   - Designate a staff member to periodically taste and review cocktails to ensure they meet the set standards.
   - Use guest feedback actively to identify any lingering inconsistencies.

### Guest Recovery Strategies

1. **Engage with Guests**
   - Have staff engage with guests directly to solicit feedback and show appreciation for their patience and loyalty.
   - Offer complimentary small items or a discount on their next visit to encourage return business.

2. **Communicate Improvements**
   - Clearly communicate to your guests the steps you are taking to improve cocktail consistency and quality.
   - Use social media, newsletters, or in-house signage to update guests on your commitment to excellence.

3. **Monitor and Adapt**
   - Regularly monitor guest feedback and adjust training and menu offerings based on their input.
   - Implement a feedback loop where staff can debrief post-shift to discuss challenges and successes.

### Summary Checklist
- Create and distribute standardized recipe cards.
- Schedule and conduct focused training sessions.
- Designate a quality control staff member.
- Actively engage with guests for feedback.
- Communicate improvement efforts transparently.
- Set up a feedback loop for continuous improvement.

By focusing on these areas, you'll not only improve the consistency and quality of your cocktails but also begin to rebuild trust with your guests.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data Collection:** Integrate a system for collecting and analyzing guest feedback systematically, not just ad-hoc engagement.
  - **Technology Use:** Consider using digital tools for recipe management and staff training to ensure accessibility and consistency.
  - **Staff Incentives:** Implement a reward system for staff who consistently meet quality standards to encourage adherence.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Guest Recovery Strategy:** Offering discounts or complimentary items should be used judiciously to avoid setting a precedent that could be financially unsustainable.
  - **Quality Checks:** Avoid over-reliance on a single staff member for quality checks; instead, foster a culture of peer review and accountability.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Recipe Management:** Use a digital platform for recipe updates to ensure all staff have real-time access to the latest standards.
  - **Feedback Integration:** Develop a structured feedback system, possibly through a digital platform, to capture and analyze guest feedback efficiently.
  - **Training Program:** Establish a continuous training program with regular refreshers and updates, rather than one-off sessions.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Brevity:** Use bullet points for clarity and ensure each point is concise and actionable.
  - **Empathy and Assurance:** Include language that reassures guests of their importance and the venue’s commitment to quality.
  - **Consistency in Communication:** Maintain a consistent tone across all communication channels, focusing on transparency and accountability.
