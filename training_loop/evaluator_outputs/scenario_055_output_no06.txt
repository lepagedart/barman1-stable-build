Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights**: Include metrics or case studies showing the impact of these strategies on waste reduction and efficiency.
  - **Technology Integration**: Suggest using inventory management software to track ingredient usage and waste in real-time.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumption of Uniformity**: Avoid assuming all venues can implement the same strategies. Tailor suggestions to different types of bars (e.g., high-volume vs. craft cocktail bars).

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for regular feedback from bartenders on the practicality of these strategies, allowing for iterative improvements.
  - **Pilot Program**: Recommend starting with a pilot program to test these strategies in a controlled environment before full implementation.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Structured Approach**: Use a step-by-step guide format, starting with an assessment phase, then planning, implementation, and review.
  - **Concise Language**: Use bullet points for each strategy with clear, actionable steps.
  - **Engaging Tone**: Use a motivational tone to encourage buy-in from staff, emphasizing benefits like improved workflow and sustainability.
