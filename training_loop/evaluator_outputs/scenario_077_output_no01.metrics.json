  "notes": "The response is well-structured and provides a clear week-by-week plan. However, it lacks specific contextual details about the venue, which affects clarity and alignment. Feasibility is moderate due to assumptions about supplier availability and rapid implementation of training. Actionability could be improved with more precise steps and risk management strategies. Overall, the response is solid but could benefit from more tailored and detailed guidance.",
