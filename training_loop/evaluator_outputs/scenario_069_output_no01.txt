System Mod: Portfolio Lens

Venue Context: A large-format restaurant group is rolling out a seasonal cocktail menu. Their distributor partner wants them to highlight certain brands in portfolio.

Prompt: How can we design a seasonal menu that balances creative integrity with portfolio alignment to keep both guests and distributor partners happy?

Lloyd's Response:

To design a seasonal menu that balances creative integrity with portfolio alignment, while satisfying both guests and distributor partners, follow these strategic steps:

### Cocktail Development Strategy

1. **Integrate Portfolio Brands**  
   - Identify key brands in your distributor portfolio that fit the seasonal theme and have strong guest appeal. Prioritize these in your cocktail recipes to align with distributor expectations.

2. **Seasonal Creativity**  
   - Use seasonal ingredients to craft cocktails that highlight the unique characteristics of the portfolio spirits. For instance, pair a premium gin with fresh summer berries or use a spiced rum in a fall-inspired cocktail with apple and cinnamon.

### Operational Strategy

1. **SKU Rationalization**  
   - Limit the introduction of new SKUs by using versatile ingredients that can appear across multiple cocktails. This helps in maintaining a streamlined inventory and reduces waste.

2. **Supplier Collaboration**  
   - Work closely with distributors to understand any incentives or promotions on specific spirits, and incorporate those into your menu planning. Schedule quarterly review meetings to adjust the menu as needed based on new offerings or shifts in focus.

### Guest Experience Strategy

1. **Storytelling and Education**  
   - Train staff to share stories about the spirits and seasonal ingredients in each cocktail, enhancing the guest experience and increasing perceived value.

2. **Visual Appeal**  
   - Based on current trends, ensure cocktails have strong visual elements, such as garnishes or glassware, that enhance the guest experience without complicating service.

### Summary Checklist

- **Select Spirits**: Identify and prioritize portfolio spirits that align with the seasonal theme.
- **Menu Design**: Develop cocktails using seasonal ingredients that pair well with chosen spirits.
- **Operational Efficiency**: Streamline ingredients and limit new SKUs to maintain efficiency.
- **Partner Collaboration**: Engage with distributors for insights and adjust menu based on incentives.
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on the stories behind cocktails to enhance guest engagement.

By following these strategies, you can create a seasonal cocktail menu that maintains creative integrity and aligns with portfolio requirements, keeping both guests and distributor partners satisfied.
