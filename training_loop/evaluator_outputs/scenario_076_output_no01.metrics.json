  "notes": "The response provides a detailed plan for improving service flow at a pool bar, but lacks a clear introduction and conclusion. It assumes certain resources and capabilities without confirming their availability, which may not be feasible for all venues. The structure is generally clear, but could benefit from more consistent formatting and a more engaging tone. The response is actionable but could be more concise and tailored to specific venue needs.",
