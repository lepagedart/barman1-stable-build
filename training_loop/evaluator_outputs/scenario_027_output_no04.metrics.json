  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for preparing a banquet with limited resources. The use of bullet points and sections enhances readability, and the action checklist is practical. However, the response could benefit from more specific venue context and guest preferences to tailor the plan further. Additionally, the suggestion for a 10-minute mock service may be unrealistic, and pre-dilution should be reconsidered based on venue policies. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with more detailed context and feasibility considerations.",
