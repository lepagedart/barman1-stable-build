  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear strategy for a cocktail menu, balancing classic appeal with innovation. The operational considerations and summary checklist enhance actionability. However, it lacks specific venue context and pricing strategy, which are crucial for alignment with the gastropub's target demographic. Simplifying some cocktail specs could improve feasibility during peak hours. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
