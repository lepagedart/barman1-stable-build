  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive strategy for designing a distributor-sponsored cocktail menu. It includes clear steps and considerations for theme integration, cost management, and guest engagement. However, it could benefit from more precise language and prioritization of steps. The feedback mechanism and legal compliance aspects are missing, and some engagement tactics may not be feasible for all venues. Overall, the response aligns well with the venue's identity and financial goals.",
