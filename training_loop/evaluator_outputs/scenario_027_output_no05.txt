Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, prep_efficiency, workflow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize fast prep, smart batching, and event-day logistics. Skip long-term program design.

Venue Context: Hotel bar staff have only 2 hours to prep before a 200-person banquet with a limited drink menu.

Prompt: We’ve only got 2 hours to set up for a 200-person banquet. How do we prioritize batching and prep so we can execute cleanly with minimal staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently prepare for a 200-person banquet with limited setup time and staff, prioritize batching and streamlined prep. Here's a focused plan:

### Batching Strategy

1. **Identify High-Volume Cocktails**:
   - Choose 2-3 cocktails that can be pre-batched and are popular for your audience. Consider classics like a Negroni, Margarita, or a simple Highball variant.

2. **Batch the Base Spirits**:
   - Mix the base spirits for each cocktail in large format containers. This reduces individual measuring during service.
   - Example: For a Negroni, batch gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth in equal parts.

3. **Simplified Modifiers**:
   - Pre-dilute with water if the cocktail requires stirring or shaking. This ensures consistency and speed.

### Prep Essentials

1. **Garnishes**:
   - Pre-slice or prepare all necessary garnishes such as lime wheels, lemon twists, or orange slices. Store them in labeled containers for easy access.

2. **Ice Management**:
   - Ensure ice is easily accessible and pre-portioned if possible. Consider placing ice bins at multiple stations to avoid bottlenecks.

3. **Service Setup**:
   - Arrange stations with all necessary tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) and ensure a clear path for service flow.

### Execution Focus

- **Staff Roles**: Assign specific tasks to each staff member, such as pouring, garnishing, or serving, to maximize efficiency.
- **Station Layout**: Set up stations with a logical flow to minimize movement (e.g., batch bottle → ice → glass → garnish).
- **Quick Training**: Brief staff on the cocktail recipes, batching process, and service flow to ensure everyone is aligned.

### Action Checklist

- [ ] Batch base spirits and mixers in labeled containers.
- [ ] Pre-slice and organize garnishes.
- [ ] Set up ice stations and service flow path.
- [ ] Assign specific roles to staff and conduct a quick briefing.
- [ ] Conduct a 10-minute mock service to test the flow.

By focusing on these key areas, you'll be able to execute the banquet service efficiently and effectively, even with minimal staff.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Preferences**: Include a step to gather information on guest preferences or dietary restrictions to tailor the cocktail selection.
  - **Non-Alcoholic Options**: Mention the preparation of non-alcoholic beverages to cater to all guests.
  - **Post-Event Plan**: Outline a process for post-event cleanup and restocking to ensure smooth operations.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Complexity of Cocktails**: Suggest simpler cocktails if the staff is limited or inexperienced, to avoid overcomplicating the service.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Check**: Implement a pre-event inventory check to ensure all ingredients and tools are available.
  - **Communication Protocol**: Establish a communication protocol for staff to address issues quickly during service.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Create a system for collecting feedback post-event to improve future operations.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use bullet points for each major step to enhance clarity and make the guide more actionable.
  - **Prioritization**: Clearly prioritize tasks to help staff focus on the most critical elements first.
  - **Encouragement**: Add a motivational note to boost staff morale and emphasize teamwork.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the banquet service, ensuring a successful event.
