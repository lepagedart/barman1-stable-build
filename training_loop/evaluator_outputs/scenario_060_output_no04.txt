Title: Pop-Up Wedding Bar: Throughput With Minimal Power/Ice

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, workflow, speed_of_service, layout_flow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Activate Event Setup Lens + Layout Lens. Provide station maps (ASCII ok), throughput targets (drinks/min), batching math, ice/mixer cadence, contingency plans, and a 15-min pre-shift brief.

Venue Context: Farm venue with limited power, 250 guests, two 6-foot folding bars, 3 bartenders, no back-of-house ice machine. 90-minute peak right after ceremony.

Prompt: Design the full pop-up service plan to keep lines short and quality high—menu design, batching, layout, staffing roles, and backup plans for ice/power hiccups.

Lloyd's Response:

Here's a comprehensive service plan to ensure your pop-up bar operates efficiently, even during peak times, while maintaining high-quality cocktails and minimizing wait times.

### Menu Design
- **Streamlined Selection**: Limit the menu to 5–6 cocktails focusing on simplicity and speed. Choose drinks that share ingredients to minimize prep time and SKU load.
- **Drink Types**: Include highballs, spritzes, and spirit-forward drinks that don't require shaking.
- **Cross-Utilized Ingredients**: Use versatile syrups and infusions applicable to multiple drinks, like a citrus syrup that works in both a gin highball and a vodka spritz.

### Batching
- **Pre-Batched Cocktails**: Batch spirit-only cocktails like Negronis or Old Fashioneds. Store in secure containers with spouts for quick service.
- **Shelf Life**: Ensure batched cocktails are stored in coolers to maintain freshness, with a shelf life of 2–3 days.
- **Ice-Resilient Options**: Offer at least one cocktail that can be served over crushed ice or with minimal dilution, like a Tiki-style punch.

### Layout
- **Station Map**: 
  - Designate separate areas for order-taking, drink assembly, and pickup to streamline the workflow.
  - Use a U-shaped bar layout to minimize bartender movement and facilitate faster service.
- **Reach Zones**:
  - **Zone A (0–18")**: Place jiggers, frequently used spirits, and tools within immediate reach.
  - **Zone B (18–30")**: Store secondary ingredients and backup glassware.
  - **Zone C (>30")**: Keep bulk supplies, backup ice, and items for restock.

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartender 1**: Dedicated to batching and restocking, ensuring there's always a supply of pre-batched cocktails ready.
- **Bartender 2**: Focuses on assembly and serving of drinks, maximizing speed and efficiency.
- **Support Staff**: One runner responsible for handling orders and delivering drinks to guests, minimizing congestion at the bar.

### Backup Plans
- **Ice Management**: 
  - Use insulated bins to store backup ice and reduce melt.
  - Have a contingency plan for additional ice delivery if needed.
- **Power Hiccups**: 
  - Ensure all batched cocktails and perishable items are stored in coolers with ice packs.
  - Keep a manual shaker and hand crank ice crusher as fallback options.

### Summary Checklist
1. Finalize the streamlined menu and ensure ingredient cross-utilization.
2. Batch cocktails in advance and store securely.
3. Arrange bar layout for efficient service with designated reach zones.
4. Assign clear roles to staff to enhance operational flow.
5. Implement backup measures for ice and power interruptions.

By following this plan, your pop-up bar can maintain high service quality and efficiency, even under challenging conditions.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Customer Experience**: Address guest interaction strategies to enhance the overall experience, such as personalized service or themed elements.
  - **Sustainability Practices**: Consider incorporating eco-friendly practices, like reusable straws or compostable cups, to align with modern consumer values.
  - **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a system for gathering customer feedback to continuously improve service and offerings.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Detail Level**: Avoid overly prescriptive details that may not apply to all pop-up contexts, such as specific bar layouts or exact staffing roles. Offer flexible guidelines instead.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Training Program**: Develop a quick training module for staff to ensure consistency in service and familiarity with the menu and processes.
  - **Inventory Management**: Introduce a digital inventory tracking system to monitor ingredient levels and reduce waste.
  - **Real-Time Adjustments**: Set up a system for real-time adjustments based on customer flow and demand, such as dynamic staffing or menu tweaks.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, focusing on key actions and outcomes.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Frame recommendations as direct actions (e.g., "Implement a training program" instead of "Consider a training program").
  - **Prioritization**: Highlight the most critical steps to ensure focus on high-impact areas first.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can provide a more tailored, flexible, and customer-focused service plan that enhances the pop-up bar's operation and guest satisfaction.
