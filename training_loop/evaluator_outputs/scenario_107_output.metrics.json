  "notes": "The response provides a good starting point with practical strategies for batching and workflow improvements. However, it lacks specific venue context, which is crucial for tailoring the advice. The structure could be more concise, and the inclusion of staff training and customer experience considerations would enhance feasibility and actionability. The feedback loop and inventory management suggestions are valuable but need clearer integration into the main strategies. Overall, the response is moderately aligned with the prompt but requires refinement for client readiness.",
