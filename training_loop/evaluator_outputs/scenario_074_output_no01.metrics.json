  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key compliance areas for a patio bar. It provides clear steps and a checklist, enhancing actionability. However, it could benefit from more specific regulatory references and a discussion on training frequency. The suggestion to use wristbands for all patrons might be impractical, and the server scripts could allow for more flexibility. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed for specificity and practicality.",
