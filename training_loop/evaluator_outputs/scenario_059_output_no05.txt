Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Activate Portfolio Lens. Map 3 tiers of brand placement (core, feature, experimental) with incentives and co-marketing. Include a 90-day review cadence and a staff brief for brand storytelling.

Venue Context: Modern brasserie buying primarily through Breakthru. They want deeper incentives and marketing support but are wary of a menu that reads like an ad.

Prompt: Help us align the cocktail list with Breakthru’s portfolio targets without cheapening the guest experience. Propose placements, guardrails, and how we’ll track value from the partnership.

Lloyd's Response:

To align your cocktail list with Breakthru’s portfolio targets while maintaining a premium guest experience, you should focus on strategic placements, operational guardrails, and value tracking. Here’s a concise plan to achieve this:

### Financial Impact
- **Pour Cost Targets**: Set a target pour cost percentage for Breakthru products, ideally between 18-22% to ensure profitability while meeting portfolio goals.
- **SKU Rationalization**: Focus on a core selection of Breakthru’s best-selling or most promoted spirits. Limit unique SKUs to avoid overstock and simplify inventory management.
- **Incentive Tracking**: Establish a quarterly review process with Breakthru to assess incentives and adjust placements based on performance.

### Supplier Integration
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Schedule regular meetings with Breakthru representatives to discuss performance metrics, explore new product launches, and align on promotional strategies.
- **Menu Adaptations**: Be prepared to adjust the cocktail list in response to incentive changes, ensuring that new placements align with both guest expectations and financial goals.

### Operational Processes
- **SKU Mapping**: Clearly map Breakthru products to their corresponding cocktails, ensuring staff can easily identify and upsell these items.
- **Par Level Management**: Maintain optimal stock levels for Breakthru products to prevent outages and over-purchasing.
- **Substitution Protocols**: Develop a list of approved substitutes for Breakthru products to ensure consistency and availability.

### Staff Training
- **Brand Education Modules**: Implement training sessions focused on Breakthru’s portfolio, highlighting key selling points and brand stories to enhance guest interactions.
- **Upselling Scripts**: Provide staff with scripts and techniques for effectively recommending Breakthru-based cocktails.

### Guest Perception
- **Premium Feel**: Ensure that the use of Breakthru products does not come off as a sales push. Highlight quality and craftsmanship in cocktail descriptions and presentations.
- **Feedback Loop**: Use guest feedback to refine the menu and service approach, ensuring that portfolio-driven choices remain guest-centric.

### Summary Checklist
1. Set pour cost targets and rationalize SKUs for Breakthru products.
2. Schedule quarterly reviews with Breakthru for performance and incentive tracking.
3. Implement SKU mapping and substitution protocols for operational consistency.
4. Conduct staff training on Breakthru’s portfolio and upselling techniques.
5. Monitor guest feedback to ensure a premium experience remains at the forefront.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Breakthru’s portfolio into your cocktail program without compromising the guest experience.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest-Centric Metrics**: Include specific metrics to measure guest satisfaction related to Breakthru products, such as NPS scores or specific feedback on cocktails.
  - **Diverse Portfolio Representation**: Ensure a balanced representation of Breakthru's diverse product range, not just best-sellers, to cater to varied guest preferences.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Incentive Tracking Complexity**: Simplify the incentive tracking process by integrating it into existing sales tracking systems rather than establishing a separate quarterly review.
  - **Substitution Protocols**: Avoid overemphasizing substitution protocols, which can confuse staff; instead, focus on ensuring primary product availability.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Integrated POS System**: Use a POS system that tracks Breakthru product sales and integrates with inventory management to streamline operations and reporting.
  - **Feedback Integration**: Implement a digital feedback system that directly links guest comments to specific menu items, allowing for real-time adjustments.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points consistently throughout the response for clarity and ease of reading.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use more direct, action-oriented language to specify who is responsible for each task (e.g., "Bar Manager to set pour cost targets").
  - **Consistency**: Ensure consistent terminology when referring to Breakthru products and operational processes to avoid confusion.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can create a more effective and guest-focused strategy for integrating Breakthru’s portfolio into the cocktail program.
