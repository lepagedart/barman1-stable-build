  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for a winter-themed cocktail menu. The batching strategy is feasible and operational notes are practical. However, it could benefit from more detailed ingredient sourcing and allergen information. The suggestions for improvement are relevant and align with the initial response, but could be more concise.",
