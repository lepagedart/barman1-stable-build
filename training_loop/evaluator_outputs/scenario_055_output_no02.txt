Title: Waste Reduction at a High-Volume Sports Bar

Tags: sustainability, cost_control, training, prep

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize waste tracking, garnish utilization, and batch management.

Venue Context: A sports bar serving 600+ covers per night wants to cut waste from citrus and mixers.

Prompt: What waste-reduction practices can we put in place that wonâ€™t slow down our bartenders during peak hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To implement waste-reduction practices that won't slow down your bartenders during peak hours, consider integrating the following strategies:

### Ingredient Cross-Utilization
- **Shared Ingredients**: Align cocktails to share common ingredients, which reduces SKU load and speeds up service. For instance, use a single syrup or infusion across multiple drinks.

### Efficient Garnish Use
- **Edible Garnishes**: Use garnishes that are made from cocktail ingredients, such as citrus twists or edible flowers, which can be prepped in batches and stored efficiently.

### Pre-Prep Techniques
- **Batched Syrups and Juices**: Prepare syrups and fresh juices in advance, stored in easy-pour bottles to streamline the service process. Ensure they are labeled with prep dates and stored at optimal temperatures to reduce spoilage.

### Zero-Waste Techniques
- **Full-Utilization**: Use all parts of ingredients, such as citrus rinds for oleo saccharum, which can be pre-made and stored for use in cocktails, enhancing flavor without added waste.

### Training and SOPs
- **Staff Training**: Educate staff on waste-conscious practices and efficient station organization to minimize movement and time spent searching for ingredients during busy periods.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively reduce waste while maintaining speed and efficiency behind the bar.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Data-Driven Insights:** Include metrics or case studies to demonstrate the effectiveness of these strategies in similar venues.
  - **Feedback Loop:** Suggest a method for collecting bartender feedback on these practices to ensure they are practical and effective during peak hours.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Assumptions on Ingredient Availability:** Avoid assuming all venues have access to specific ingredients like edible flowers. Provide alternatives or a decision matrix for ingredient selection.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Standardized Recipe Cards:** Implement standardized recipe cards that highlight cross-utilization opportunities and zero-waste techniques.
  - **Inventory Management System:** Recommend a digital inventory system to track ingredient usage and waste, providing real-time data for decision-making.
  - **Regular Audits:** Schedule regular audits of waste-reduction practices to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each strategy to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use more directive language, e.g., "Implement," "Establish," "Conduct," to emphasize actionable steps.
  - **Clear Segmentation:** Separate strategies into categories such as "Preparation," "Service," and "Training" for better organization and clarity.
