  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive approach to leveraging POS and inventory tech across multiple venues. The response is clear and actionable, with a focus on system integration, accuracy, and forecasting. However, it could benefit from more specific venue context and a simplified approach to predictive ordering. Additionally, including a plan for staff training and customer experience enhancement would improve alignment with venue needs.",
