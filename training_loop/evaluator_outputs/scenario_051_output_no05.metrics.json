  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for creating a sustainable and exciting fall cocktail menu. The use of bullet points and clear sections enhances clarity and readability. However, the response could benefit from more specific venue context and target audience details to tailor the recommendations further. Additionally, while the focus on sustainability and guest experience is strong, the response could include more on inventory management and supplier partnerships as suggested in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed for full alignment with the scenario requirements.",
