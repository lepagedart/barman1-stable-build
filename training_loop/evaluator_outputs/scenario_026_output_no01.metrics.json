  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, feasible plan for addressing the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are actionable and align with the goal of improving guest experience. However, the response could benefit from more concise language and a stronger emphasis on empathy towards guests. The suggestions for what Lloyd should have done are insightful but could be integrated more seamlessly into the main response.",
