  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear strategies for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu. It includes actionable steps and a checklist for implementation. However, it could benefit from a stronger focus on guest experience and cost analysis. The response assumes certain resources and capabilities without assessing the venue's current state, which could affect feasibility. Overall, it aligns well with the prompt but could be improved with more emphasis on feedback mechanisms and cost management.",
