  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for training staff in upselling techniques. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more specific examples or case studies. The feasibility is reasonable, but the response could be improved by addressing potential challenges in staff receptivity and setting realistic targets. The alignment with the goal of enhancing upselling skills is strong, but more context about the venue and audience would enhance the tailored approach.",
