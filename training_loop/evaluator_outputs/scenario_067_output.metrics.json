  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a comprehensive overview of strategies to reduce waste in a citrus-heavy cocktail program. However, it lacks specific context about the venue, which affects clarity and alignment. The feasibility of implementing citric acid solutions without assessing the venue's capability is questionable. The structure is generally clear but could benefit from more concise, prioritized bullet points. Actionability is moderate, as the response suggests several strategies but lacks detailed steps and responsibilities. Including a cost analysis and supplier collaboration would enhance the response's alignment with practical business needs.",
