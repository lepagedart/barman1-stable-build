  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a detailed plan for optimizing bar efficiency during a pre-theater rush. The use of zones and a build path is clear and actionable. However, it could benefit from a simplified approach to reach zones and build path steps to avoid overwhelming staff. The addition of a staffing plan, training protocols, and contingency plans would enhance feasibility and alignment with venue needs. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor adjustments.",
