  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a detailed plan for optimizing poolside bar stations. It is clear and feasible, with actionable steps. However, it could benefit from a stronger focus on guest experience and staff training. Simplifying some sections and merging redundant parts would enhance clarity and structure. The response aligns well with the prompt but could include more on digital tools and feedback systems for continuous improvement.",
