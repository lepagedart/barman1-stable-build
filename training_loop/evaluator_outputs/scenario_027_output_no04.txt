Title: Limited Prep Time Before Large Banquet

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, prep_efficiency, workflow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize fast prep, smart batching, and event-day logistics. Skip long-term program design.

Venue Context: Hotel bar staff have only 2 hours to prep before a 200-person banquet with a limited drink menu.

Prompt: We’ve only got 2 hours to set up for a 200-person banquet. How do we prioritize batching and prep so we can execute cleanly with minimal staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently prepare for a 200-person banquet with limited setup time and staff, prioritize batching and streamlined prep. Here's a focused plan:

### Batching Strategy

1. **Identify High-Volume Cocktails**:
   - Choose 2-3 cocktails that can be pre-batched and are popular for your audience. Consider classics like a Negroni, Margarita, or a simple Highball variant.

2. **Batch the Base Spirits**:
   - Mix the base spirits for each cocktail in large format containers. This reduces individual measuring during service.
   - Example: For a Negroni, batch gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth in equal parts.

3. **Simplified Modifiers**:
   - Pre-dilute with water if the cocktail requires stirring or shaking. This ensures consistency and speed.

### Prep Essentials

1. **Garnishes**:
   - Pre-slice or prepare all necessary garnishes such as lime wheels, lemon twists, or orange slices. Store them in labeled containers for easy access.

2. **Ice Management**:
   - Ensure ice is easily accessible and pre-portioned if possible. Consider placing ice bins at multiple stations to avoid bottlenecks.

3. **Service Setup**:
   - Arrange stations with all necessary tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) and ensure a clear path for service flow.

### Execution Focus

- **Staff Roles**: Assign specific tasks to each staff member, such as pouring, garnishing, or serving, to maximize efficiency.
- **Station Layout**: Set up stations with a logical flow to minimize movement (e.g., batch bottle → ice → glass → garnish).
- **Quick Training**: Brief staff on the cocktail recipes, batching process, and service flow to ensure everyone is aligned.

### Action Checklist

- [ ] Batch base spirits and mixers in labeled containers.
- [ ] Pre-slice and organize garnishes.
- [ ] Set up ice stations and service flow path.
- [ ] Assign specific roles to staff and conduct a quick briefing.
- [ ] Conduct a 10-minute mock service to test the flow.

By focusing on these key areas, you'll be able to execute the banquet service efficiently and effectively, even with minimal staff.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., hotel, event hall) to tailor the setup and service flow.
  - **Guest Preferences**: Include a step to gather insights on guest preferences or dietary restrictions to inform cocktail selection.
  - **Equipment Availability**: Address the availability of necessary equipment (e.g., glassware, refrigeration) to ensure feasibility.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Pre-Dilution**: Avoid recommending pre-dilution with water without confirming the venue's policy on cocktail preparation standards.
  - **Mock Service**: Suggest a more realistic time frame for mock service, as 10 minutes may be insufficient for a comprehensive test.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Check**: Implement a pre-event inventory check to ensure all ingredients and tools are available.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism post-event to refine processes for future banquets.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity**: Use bullet points consistently for all sections to enhance readability.
  - **Conciseness**: Remove redundant phrases like "efficiently and effectively" to maintain a concise tone.
  - **Action Orientation**: Begin each section with a clear action verb to emphasize steps (e.g., "Identify," "Batch," "Arrange").

By addressing these elements, Lloyd can provide a more comprehensive and tailored plan for banquet preparation.
