  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing costs and waste in a cocktail program. The use of bullet points enhances clarity and readability. The suggestions are feasible, though some, like agar clarification, may be complex for certain venues. The response aligns well with the goal of maintaining quality while reducing waste. However, it could benefit from including sustainability practices and addressing potential storage issues more explicitly. Overall, it's a strong, client-ready response with minor areas for improvement.",
