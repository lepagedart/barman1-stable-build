  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas for compliance and operational readiness. It provides clear steps and an action checklist, making it actionable. However, it could benefit from more concise language and the inclusion of regulatory updates and supplier verification. The suggestion to consult an insurance advisor is appropriate, but more specific guidance on operational drills could improve feasibility. Overall, it aligns well with the client's needs but could be slightly refined for clarity and precision.",
