Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on pop-up ergonomics, batching math, and guest throughput targets. Build in contingency plans for glassware, mixers, and staffing.

Venue Context: Corporate holiday party with 500 guests at a rented loft. Temporary bar, limited back-of-house support, one shot at execution.

Prompt: We’re setting up a one-night bar for a corporate holiday event with 500 people. We need a plan that keeps lines down, feels premium, and avoids massive waste at the end. How do we design the menu, batching, and staffing flow?

Lloyd's Response:

For a corporate holiday event serving 500 guests, efficiency and premium service are key. Here's a streamlined plan focusing on menu design, batching, and staffing flow to ensure smooth service without excess waste.

### Menu Design
- **Limited Selection**: Choose 3–4 signature cocktails that balance classic appeal and ease of batching.
  - **Signature Cocktail**: A festive take on a classic, such as a Cranberry Moscow Mule.
  - **Whiskey-Based Option**: Consider a simple Old Fashioned or a Whiskey Sour.
  - **Sparkling Option**: A Champagne cocktail, like a Kir Royale, for a festive touch.
  - **Non-Alcoholic Option**: Offer a mocktail like a Ginger Lemon Fizz.

### Batching Strategy
- **Pre-Batch Cocktails**: Prepare liquor-only batches for each cocktail to streamline service.
  - **Shelf Life**: Ensure pre-batched cocktails are used within 24-48 hours for optimal freshness.
  - **Storage**: Use large dispensers or pitchers for quick access and refills.
- **Glassware**: Use uniform glassware to simplify service and avoid shortages.

### Staffing Flow
- **Bar Setup**: Establish multiple stations to reduce wait times.
  - **Station 1**: Highball and Sparkling Cocktails.
  - **Station 2**: Whiskey and Signature Cocktails.
  - **Station 3**: Non-Alcoholic and Beer/Wine.
- **Staffing**: Allocate 1 bartender per 75-100 guests, with additional support staff for glassware and restocking.
- **Service Flow**: Implement a one-way traffic pattern to minimize congestion and ensure smooth guest flow.

### Operational Notes
- **Prep Time**: Allocate 2-3 hours for batching, setup, and staff briefing before the event.
- **Waste Management**: Use jiggers for precise pours to control liquor usage and minimize waste.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 20-minute run-through before guests arrive to identify potential bottlenecks.

### Action Checklist
1. Finalize and test cocktail recipes for batching.
2. Coordinate staff roles and conduct a pre-event briefing.
3. Set up bar stations with clear signage and access to pre-batched cocktails.
4. Execute a mock service to ensure preparedness.
5. Implement precise inventory tracking to monitor consumption and prevent shortages.

By focusing on a limited, crowd-pleasing menu and optimizing your batching and staffing strategy, you'll provide a premium experience while maintaining efficiency and minimizing waste.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Guest Preferences**: Include a survey or data collection method to understand guest preferences for better menu alignment.
  - **Dietary Restrictions**: Address potential dietary restrictions or allergies in the menu design.
  - **Backup Plan**: Outline contingency plans for unexpected issues like staff shortages or equipment failure.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Menu Complexity**: Suggest a simpler menu with fewer options to reduce complexity and potential errors.
  - **Staffing Ratios**: Reassess staffing ratios; 1 bartender per 75 guests may be insufficient during peak times.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a real-time inventory tracking system to monitor stock levels and prevent shortages.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a post-event feedback process to gather insights for future improvements.
  - **Training Protocols**: Develop a standardized training module for staff to ensure consistency in service.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for operational notes to enhance readability.
  - **Clarity**: Clearly label each section with headers for quick reference.
  - **Actionable Language**: Use direct, actionable language in the action checklist to ensure clarity and execution.

By addressing these elements, Lloyd can enhance the planning and execution of the event, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable experience for all guests.
