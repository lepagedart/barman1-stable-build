  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a feasible cocktail menu strategy. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from more concise language and a clearer pricing strategy. The alignment with the gastropub's context is good, but more audience analysis and market research would enhance the proposal.",
