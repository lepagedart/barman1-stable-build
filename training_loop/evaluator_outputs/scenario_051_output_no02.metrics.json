  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key aspects of designing a sustainable fall cocktail menu. It provides clear strategies and examples, making it actionable. However, it could benefit from integrating guest feedback and supplier collaboration more explicitly. The response maintains a good balance between sustainability, guest experience, and cost management, but could improve clarity with more bullet points and direct action verbs as suggested in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section.",
