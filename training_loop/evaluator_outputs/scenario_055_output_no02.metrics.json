  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for waste reduction in a bar setting. The suggestions are clear and feasible, though the inclusion of data-driven insights and feedback mechanisms could enhance the response. The structure is logical, but further segmentation and more directive language could improve clarity and actionability. Overall, the response aligns well with the prompt's requirements.",
