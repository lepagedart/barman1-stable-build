  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a detailed and practical approach to optimizing a bar layout for two bartenders, focusing on efficiency and minimizing movement. However, it lacks customization for specific venue constraints and does not address safety and ergonomic considerations. The structure could be improved with clearer prioritization and a more collaborative tone. The response is feasible but could benefit from more actionable steps and integration of technology solutions.",
