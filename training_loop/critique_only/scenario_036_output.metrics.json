  "notes": "The response provides a practical plan for streamlining operations but lacks clarity in some areas, such as the definition of 'heat-resistant' ingredients. The structure could be improved by prioritizing actions and using more precise language. The actionability is moderate, as some recommendations need more detail, particularly regarding legal considerations for pre-batching. Alignment with the venue's needs could be enhanced by addressing customer experience and feedback mechanisms.",
