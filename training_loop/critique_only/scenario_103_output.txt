Title: Cafe to Bar Conversion

Tags: Efficiency, setup constraints, Menu design, venue alignment, batching

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: A coffee shop that becomes a bar after 4pm using the same counter and staff. No dedicated bar setup or ice machine.

Prompt: We’re running evening cocktail service out of our café. The transition is bumpy and we’re not profitable yet. I need a drink menu that makes sense for this space and workflow. What should I change?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your evening cocktail service and enhance profitability, consider a streamlined menu that aligns with your café's existing setup and workflow. Here's a practical strategy:

### Menu Design
- **Focus on Core Families**: Limit your menu to 4-5 cocktail families like sours, highballs, and old fashioned variants. This keeps the menu diverse yet manageable.
- **Re-usable Ingredients**: Use ingredients that overlap with your café’s existing inventory where possible. For instance, leverage syrups or garnishes already in use for other beverages.
- **Low-ABV Options**: Include a couple of low-ABV or no-alcohol mocktails to cater to all guests and utilize ingredients like teas or fresh juices.

### Example Menu Items
1. **Classic Sour**
   - Spec: 2 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz lemon juice, 0.5 oz simple syrup
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Rocks / Old-fashioned glass / Lemon wheel
   - Method: Shake with ice, strain
   - Cost Notes: Low-cost components, high margin

2. **Refreshing Highball**
   - Spec: 1.5 oz gin, 0.5 oz lime cordial, top with soda
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Highball / Collins glass / Lime wedge
   - Method: Build in glass over ice
   - Cost Notes: Uses base spirits, high turnover items

3. **Herbal Old Fashioned**
   - Spec: 2 oz whiskey, 0.25 oz herbal liqueur, 2 dashes bitters
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Large cube / Rocks glass / Orange twist
   - Method: Stir with ice, strain over fresh ice
   - Cost Notes: Elevated with a premium liqueur, slightly higher cost

### Operational Adjustments
- **Batching**: Consider batching simple syrup or juice mixes during prep to speed up service.
- **Station Setup**: Organize your station to keep high-turnover ingredients within immediate reach (Zone A).
- **Training**: Ensure staff are trained to execute the menu efficiently and understand the flavor profiles to suggest upsells.

### Profitability Considerations
- **Pricing Strategy**: Ensure pricing reflects both the ingredient costs and the operational effort. Aim for a 20-25% pour cost.
- **Monitoring**: Track sales and adjust the menu based on what’s popular or underperforming.

By focusing on a concise menu and aligning it with your café's existing workflow, you should see improvements in service smoothness and profitability.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context:** Lloyd should have included specific details about the café's current beverage offerings, customer demographics, and peak service times to tailor the recommendations more precisely.
  - **Staffing Considerations:** There is no mention of current staff skill levels or availability, which are crucial for implementing new menu items and operational changes.
  - **Feedback Loop:** No system for obtaining customer feedback on the new menu items was suggested, which is essential for iterative improvements.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Menu Complexity:** While the menu is streamlined, the inclusion of premium ingredients like herbal liqueur might not align with the café's existing brand or customer expectations without prior analysis.
  - **Operational Assumptions:** Assumes existing staff can handle batching and new station setups without additional resources or time, which may not be feasible.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Pilot Testing:** Implement a pilot phase for the new menu items to gather data on preparation time, customer reception, and profitability before full-scale rollout.
  - **Inventory Management:** Develop a system to track ingredient usage and waste, ensuring alignment with the proposed menu changes.
  - **Staff Feedback Sessions:** Regularly scheduled meetings to discuss challenges and successes with the new menu and operational changes, fostering a collaborative improvement environment.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Precision:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.
  - **Actionable Steps:** Clearly delineate between strategic recommendations and immediate action items to guide implementation.
  - **Empathetic Tone:** Acknowledge potential challenges staff may face with changes, and offer supportive solutions to mitigate these issues.
