System Mod: Emphasize food-beverage synergy, seasonal appeal, and kitchen coordination.

Venue Context: Farm-to-table restaurant with a rotating food menu every season. Ownership wants cocktails that match the kitchenâ€™s focus without overcomplicating bar operations.

Prompt: Our chef changes the menu every three months. How do we design cocktails that highlight seasonal ingredients and align with the food program without creating chaos for the bar team?

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
**EXACTLY: What Lloyd Should Have Done:**

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement robust error handling to manage server errors gracefully.
  - Use try-catch blocks to capture exceptions and provide a user-friendly error message.
  - Log the error details for further diagnosis without exposing technical details to the user.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - Set up a monitoring system to alert the technical team immediately when a server error occurs.
  - Schedule regular maintenance checks to ensure server stability and prevent downtime.
  - Implement a fallback mechanism that allows basic functionality or an alternative service when the main service is down.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - Ensure error messages are clear, concise, and non-technical. Example: "We're experiencing technical difficulties. Please try again later."
  - Provide a contact or support option for users to report issues or get assistance.
  - Maintain a professional and reassuring tone to mitigate user frustration and maintain trust.

- **Proactive Measures:**
  - Conduct load testing to identify potential bottlenecks and optimize server performance.
  - Regularly update and patch the server software to protect against vulnerabilities.
  - Document and review incident response procedures to improve future handling of similar issues.
