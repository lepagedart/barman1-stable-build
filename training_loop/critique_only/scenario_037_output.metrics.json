  "notes": "The response provides a solid plan for a corporate holiday event bar operation, but lacks specific details about the venue and guest demographics, which are crucial for tailoring the recommendations. The structure is generally clear, but could benefit from more concise bullet points and a more formal tone. The feasibility of the batching strategy and staffing recommendations could be improved by considering a range based on guest count and acknowledging that not all cocktails can be pre-batched. Actionability is moderate, with some steps outlined but lacking in detail for implementation. Overall, the response aligns with the prompt but could be enhanced with more context and precision.",
