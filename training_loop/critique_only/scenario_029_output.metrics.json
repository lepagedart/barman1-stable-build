  "notes": "Lloyd's response provides a detailed strategy for optimizing bar service during concerts, focusing on setup and menu design. However, it lacks a staffing strategy and technology integration, which are crucial for feasibility. The structure is somewhat clear but could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization of actions. The recommendations are actionable but could be more aligned with venue-specific needs and guest experience considerations.",
