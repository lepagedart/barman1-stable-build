  "notes": "The response lacks a direct solution to the error encountered and does not provide immediate steps for resolution. While it outlines general best practices for error handling and system robustness, it fails to address the specific incident effectively. The structure could be improved by prioritizing immediate actions and clearer communication strategies. The alignment with the prompt is weak as it does not directly resolve the error message presented.",
