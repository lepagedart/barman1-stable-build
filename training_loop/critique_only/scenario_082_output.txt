Title: Zero-Waste Garnish & Juice Program

Tags: sustainability, prep, batching, inventory, costing

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize yield tracking, repurposing byproducts, freezing strategy, and safe shelf-life. Include a weekly zero-waste scorecard and staff prep checklists.

Venue Context: Craft cocktail bar producing 25L citrus weekly with variable fruit quality; limited cold storage; team wants greener practices without slowing service.

Prompt: Design a zero-waste juice and garnish workflow: how to capture peels/pith/pulp, stabilize juice, pre-batch efficiently, and measure savings without sacrificing quality.

What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage server errors gracefully. Ensure that the system provides a user-friendly error message and logs the issue for further investigation.
  
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up monitoring tools to detect server errors in real-time. Configure alerts to notify the technical team immediately when such errors occur, allowing for quick resolution.

- **Redundancy and Failover**: Introduce redundancy in the system architecture to prevent single points of failure. Implement failover mechanisms to switch to backup systems in case of server issues.

- **Load Testing**: Conduct regular load testing to ensure the server can handle high traffic and stress conditions without failing.

- **Communication Protocol**: Establish a clear communication protocol for when errors occur. Ensure that users are informed of the issue and the expected resolution time.

- **Documentation and Training**: Maintain comprehensive documentation on how to handle server errors and train the team regularly on these procedures.

- **Tone/Structure**: Ensure responses are structured to first acknowledge the issue, provide a brief explanation, and outline the steps being taken to resolve it. Maintain a professional and reassuring tone to instill confidence in users.
