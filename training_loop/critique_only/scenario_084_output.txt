Title: Pour-Cost Spike & Shrinkage Hunt

Tags: profitability, inventory, variance, training, controls

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on fast variance detection, root-cause tree, and corrective controls. Include blind-count SOP, jigger vs free-pour test, and a 14-day recovery plan.

Venue Context: Downtown lounge seeing pour cost rise from 21% to 27% over 6 weeks; two new hires; weekend bottle-necks; inconsistent comps/voids logging.

Prompt: Build a step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix our pour-cost spike. What should we audit first, what data to pull, and which controls to put in place immediately?

Lloyd's Response:

[ERROR] Failed to reach Lloyd: 500 Server Error: INTERNAL SERVER ERROR for url: http://localhost:5000/


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Error Handling:**
  - Implement a robust error-handling mechanism to manage server errors gracefully. Ensure that the system can provide a fallback response or a meaningful error message to the user when a server error occurs.
  
- **Redundancy and Failover:**
  - Establish a redundancy system or failover mechanism to maintain service continuity in case of server issues. This could involve load balancing or having a backup server ready to take over.

- **Logging and Monitoring:**
  - Set up comprehensive logging and monitoring tools to detect and diagnose issues proactively. This includes tracking server performance, uptime, and error rates to identify potential problems before they impact users.

- **Communication Protocol:**
  - Develop a clear communication protocol for when errors occur. This should include notifying the user of the issue, providing an estimated time for resolution, and offering alternative solutions if possible.

- **System Testing:**
  - Regularly conduct stress tests and simulations to ensure the system can handle high loads and unexpected errors without crashing. This should be part of routine maintenance.

- **User Experience:**
  - Maintain a user-centric approach by ensuring that any error messages are clear, concise, and provide actionable next steps for the user.

- **Documentation:**
  - Ensure comprehensive documentation is available for troubleshooting common server errors, including step-by-step guides for resolving issues quickly.

- **Continuous Improvement:**
  - Implement a feedback loop to learn from errors and improve the system continuously. This should involve analyzing error logs, user feedback, and performance metrics to enhance reliability and user satisfaction.
