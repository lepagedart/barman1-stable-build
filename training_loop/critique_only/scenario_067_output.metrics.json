  "notes": "The response provides a good starting point for waste reduction in a cocktail program, but lacks specific context and may not be feasible for all venues. The structure is clear but could benefit from more concise and prioritized recommendations. Actionability is moderate, as some suggestions require complex systems that may not be suitable for all venues. Alignment with potential venue needs is average due to the lack of specific context.",
