  "notes": "The response provides a solid foundation for integrating seasonal cocktails with a chef-driven menu, but it lacks some key elements. Clarity could be improved by simplifying language and avoiding jargon. Feasibility is moderate, as some techniques may be too complex for all venues. The structure is generally good but could benefit from clearer prioritization of steps. Actionability is present, but the inclusion of guest feedback and sustainability practices would enhance it. Alignment with the venue's capabilities and industry trends could be better addressed.",
