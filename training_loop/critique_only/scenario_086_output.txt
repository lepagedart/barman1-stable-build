What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage server errors gracefully. Ensure that the system can provide a user-friendly message or alternative action when a 500 Internal Server Error occurs.
  
- **Redundancy and Failover**: Establish a backup system or failover mechanism to maintain functionality if the primary server fails. This could involve load balancing or a secondary server.

- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Set up real-time monitoring and alert systems to detect server issues immediately. This allows for rapid response and minimizes downtime.

- **Logging**: Ensure comprehensive logging is in place to capture detailed information about errors. This aids in diagnosing and resolving issues quickly.

- **Communication Protocol**: Develop a protocol for communicating with users during outages, including estimated resolution times and alternative contact methods.

- **Testing and Maintenance**: Regularly test the system for vulnerabilities and perform routine maintenance to prevent server errors.

- **User Experience**: Design the system to maintain a consistent and professional tone, even during errors, ensuring users feel supported and informed.

- **Documentation**: Maintain clear, up-to-date documentation on system processes and error resolution steps for quick reference by technical teams.
