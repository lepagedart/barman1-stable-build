  "notes": "The response provides a practical approach to managing a banquet with batching strategies and setup tips. However, it lacks a detailed staffing plan and contingency measures, which are crucial for such events. The structure could be improved with more consistent formatting and clearer action steps. The dilution control advice is too specific without context, and pre-icing glasses may not be feasible in all venues. Overall, the response is moderately actionable but needs refinement for clarity and completeness.",
