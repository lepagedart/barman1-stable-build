Title: Pop-Up Event – Craft Cocktail Tent

Tags: event, compliance, sustainability

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: event_lens+compliance_lens+sustainability_lens

Venue Context: Outdoor festival tent, 1,200 guests expected over 5 hours, limited refrigeration, staff mostly volunteers.

Prompt: How should we batch, set up stations, and handle compliance while minimizing waste in this temporary build?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently manage a temporary bar setup while ensuring compliance and minimizing waste, here’s a structured approach considering batching, station setup, and compliance:

### Batching Strategy
1. **Cocktail Selection**: Choose 3-4 high-demand cocktails that can be pre-batched. Opt for recipes with stable shelf lives at room temperature or chilled (e.g., spirit-forward cocktails).
2. **Batch Prep**:
   - Use sealed containers for pre-batched cocktails; label with contents and date.
   - Batch liquor-only components to maintain freshness and avoid spoilage.
   - Prepare fresh juice in smaller quantities with a clear labeling system to manage waste.
3. **Storage**: Use portable coolers or ice buckets to keep batched cocktails cold if refrigeration isn’t available.

### Station Setup
1. **Station Map**:
   ```
   [Station 1]  [Station 2]  [Station 3]
     Bartender   Bartender   Bartender
   ```
   - Position stations for optimal guest flow and accessibility.
   - Assign specific roles (e.g., Bartender 1 for ID checks and initial orders, Bartender 2 for batching and serving).

2. **Rail Loadout**:
   - Arrange bottles from left to right based on cocktail popularity.
   - Keep garnishes, ice, and frequently used tools within reach (Zone A: 0–18").

3. **Traffic Flow**:
   - Establish clear traffic lanes behind the bar to avoid collisions.
   - Use floor markings or signage to guide staff and guests.

### Compliance & Waste Management
1. **ID Verification**: Designate a team member at the entrance or bar front for checking IDs, ensuring compliance with age regulations.
2. **Waste Minimization**:
   - Regularly review par levels for garnishes and juices to adjust for demand.
   - Implement a protocol for handling leftover batched cocktails—consider repurposing or safe disposal.
   - Train staff on efficient pouring and garnish use to avoid overuse.

### Summary Checklist
- Batch high-demand cocktails with stable components.
- Optimize station layout for minimal movement.
- Ensure compliance with designated ID checks.
- Regularly review and adjust par levels for waste management.
- Conduct a 20-minute stress drill to test efficiency and compliance under peak conditions.

This approach ensures a smooth, compliant, and waste-efficient operation in a temporary bar setting.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Venue Context & Specifics:** Include details about the venue size, expected guest count, and event duration to tailor the setup and batching strategy.
  - **Inventory Management:** Outline a system for tracking inventory levels in real-time to prevent shortages or overstock.
  - **Staff Training:** Specify training protocols for staff to ensure consistency in service and adherence to compliance standards.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Station Setup Complexity:** Simplify the station setup description to avoid overwhelming staff. Focus on essential elements and prioritize flexibility.
  - **Batching Strategy Details:** Avoid over-specifying cocktail types without knowing guest preferences or event theme. Suggest a flexible menu that can adapt to real-time feedback.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Real-Time Feedback Loop:** Implement a feedback mechanism (e.g., quick surveys or direct guest feedback) to adjust offerings and operations dynamically.
  - **Digital Tools:** Use digital tools for inventory and order management to streamline operations and reduce manual errors.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Clarity:** Ensure each section has a clear objective and actionable steps. Avoid jargon or overly technical language.
  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical actions first in each section to guide immediate focus during setup and operation.

By addressing these areas, Lloyd can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of managing a temporary bar setup.
