Title: Limited Prep Time Before Large Banquet

Tags: event_setup, batching_strategies, prep_efficiency, workflow

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize fast prep, smart batching, and event-day logistics. Skip long-term program design.

Venue Context: Hotel bar staff have only 2 hours to prep before a 200-person banquet with a limited drink menu.

Prompt: Weâ€™ve only got 2 hours to set up for a 200-person banquet. How do we prioritize batching and prep so we can execute cleanly with minimal staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To efficiently manage a 200-person banquet with limited staff and a tight setup window, focus on batching and prep strategies that maximize speed and minimize complexity. Here's a practical approach:

### Batching Strategy
1. **Select High-Volume Cocktails**:
   - Choose 2-3 cocktails that can be universally appealing, such as a classic Margarita, a Whiskey Sour, and a Non-Alcoholic option like a Virgin Mojito.
   - Ensure these drinks can be batched without compromising quality.

2. **Batch in Advance**:
   - Prepare batched cocktails in bulk containers, such as food-safe Cambro containers or kegs if available. 
   - For spirit-forward options like Margaritas or Whiskey Sours, batch the base (spirit, citrus, sweetener) and keep refrigerated.

3. **Dilution Control**:
   - Pre-dilute batches to account for the ice that would be added during service. Typically, about 20% water by volume is a safe dilution ratio for these types of cocktails.

4. **Non-Alcoholic Options**:
   - Batch non-alcoholic options separately to provide a refreshing alternative. Consider using teas or flavored waters for efficiency.

### Prep and Setup
1. **Streamline Garnishes**:
   - Select simple garnishes that can be prepped and stored in advance. Lime wheels, orange twists, or mint sprigs are both visually appealing and easy to manage.
   - Arrange garnishes in labeled containers for quick access.

2. **Station Setup**:
   - Designate a single bar station with clear access to batch containers, glassware, and garnishes.
   - Use speed rails for common modifiers and tools like jiggers and cocktail spoons.

3. **Glassware and Ice**:
   - Pre-ice glasses if space and logistics allow. Otherwise, ensure ice is within easy reach of the serving station.
   - Use stackable glassware to save space and speed up service.

### Execution Checklist
- **Pre-shift Meeting**: Brief staff on the drink menu, batching process, and station setup.
- **Label Everything**: Clearly label all batches, garnishes, and tools to prevent confusion.
- **Service Flow**: Assign roles to staff for serving, refilling batches, and restocking garnishes.
- **Monitor Batch Levels**: Regularly check batch levels and replenish as needed to maintain smooth service.

Implement this plan, and you should be able to handle the banquet efficiently, keeping service smooth and guests satisfied.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces**:
  - **Staffing Plan**: Include a specific staffing plan detailing roles and responsibilities for each team member to ensure clarity and efficiency.
  - **Contingency Plan**: Address potential issues such as equipment failure or unexpected demand surges with backup solutions.
  - **Guest Experience**: Incorporate strategies to engage guests, such as a brief introduction to the drink menu or interactive elements.

- **Overreach**:
  - **Dilution Control Specificity**: Avoid prescribing a fixed dilution ratio without considering the specific characteristics of each cocktail and venue conditions. Suggest testing batches for optimal taste.
  - **Pre-Icing Glasses**: This can lead to logistical challenges and potential quality issues. Recommend evaluating venue capabilities before suggesting.

- **System/Process Solutions**:
  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a tracking system for ingredients and supplies to ensure timely replenishment and avoid shortages.
  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a mechanism for post-event feedback from staff and guests to refine future operations.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:
  - **Clarity and Precision**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.
  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use more directive language to emphasize action steps, e.g., "Assign staff roles" instead of "Assign roles to staff."
  - **Consistency**: Maintain consistent formatting across sections for a professional and organized presentation.
