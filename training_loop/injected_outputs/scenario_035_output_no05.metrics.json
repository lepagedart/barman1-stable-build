  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, actionable steps to address the issue of inconsistency in signature drinks. The plan is feasible and aligns with the goal of improving guest experience without additional staffing. However, it could benefit from more context about the venue and team dynamics to ensure the solutions are tailored effectively. The tone is professional, but a more collaborative approach could enhance team engagement. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
