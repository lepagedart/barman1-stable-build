  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for designing a cocktail list. It addresses key aspects such as simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and guest appeal. However, it lacks specific venue context and target audience details, which are crucial for tailoring the cocktail list. The response could benefit from more concise bullet points and prioritization of actions. Overall, it is a strong response but could be improved with additional context and a more concise presentation.",
