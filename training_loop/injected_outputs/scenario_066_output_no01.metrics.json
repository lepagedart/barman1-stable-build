  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear strategy for a cocktail menu, balancing classic and innovative elements. It includes practical considerations like batching and staff training. However, it lacks specific venue context and pricing strategy, which are crucial for alignment with the gastropub's identity and customer base. The response could benefit from more concise bullet points for quick staff reference and a stronger emphasis on customer feedback integration.",
