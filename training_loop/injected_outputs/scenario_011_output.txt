Title: GM Needs Beverage Program Performance Audit

Tags: costing, profit_margins, training, staff_execution, bar_performance

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Avoid technical mixology or menu design language. Imagine you’re briefing a non-hospitality executive. Stick to KPIs and recommendations.

Venue Context: 60-seat upscale casual restaurant with a wine-forward beverage program and a basic cocktail list. The GM handles both FOH and BOH responsibilities and is not a bartender.

Prompt: Can you help me evaluate how our bar program is doing? I’m not a bar guy, but I need to know if we’re leaving money on the table or undertraining staff. Just give me the high points.

Lloyd's Response:

Certainly. Here are the high points to evaluate your bar program from a profitability and training perspective:

### Cost Control and Profitability
- **Pour Costs:** Aim for a target pour cost between 18-22% for cocktails. Review each cocktail's ingredients to ensure none are exceeding this range. If they are, identify expensive components and consider alternatives or adjust pricing.
- **Inventory Management:** Implement regular stock counts and variance tracking to minimize waste and theft. This will help maintain tighter cost control and profitability.
- **Syrup and Modifier Costs:** Evaluate the cost of house-made syrups and modifiers. Ensure they are used efficiently, and explore cost-effective alternatives if necessary.

### Menu Optimization
- **Sales Analysis:** Conduct data-driven sales analysis to identify best and worst sellers. Use this information to optimize your menu, possibly removing underperforming items and highlighting popular ones.
- **Guest Feedback:** Collect guest feedback to assess perceived value and identify any gaps in training or menu offerings.

### Staff Training
- **Training Program:** Establish a basic training program to ensure staff are skilled in cocktail preparation and understand cost control principles. This can include short pre-shift training sessions or peer-led skill shares.
- **Compliance Training:** Ensure staff are trained in responsible service and allergen protocols to maintain compliance and enhance guest safety.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve profitability and ensure your staff is well-trained, ultimately enhancing your bar program's performance.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:
- Missing Specificity: Did not tailor recommendations to a defined venue type, concept, or operational scale. Should have contextualized advice (e.g., high-volume bar vs. craft cocktail lounge).
- Overreach: Mentioned "guest feedback" and "allergen protocols" without outlining actionable collection methods or integration into training.
- System/Process Gaps:
  - Did not provide concrete steps for implementing inventory management (e.g., frequency, responsible roles, software/tools).
  - Lacked a structured approach for sales analysis (e.g., timeframes, metrics, reporting cadence).
  - No mention of how to monitor or enforce pour cost targets in real time.
- Tone/Structure:
  - Too general—should use bullet points for clarity, and prioritize recommendations by impact.
  - Should separate profitability levers from training levers for easier actionability.
  - Needs more directive language (e.g., "Assign a bar lead to conduct weekly variance checks").
- Training Clarity: Did not specify training content, duration, or assessment methods. Should outline a modular training plan with measurable outcomes.
