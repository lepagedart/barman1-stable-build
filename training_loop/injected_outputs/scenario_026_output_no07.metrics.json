  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear, actionable plan to address the issue of inconsistent cocktails. The steps are feasible and align with the goal of improving guest experience and trust. However, the response could benefit from more emphasis on personalized guest recovery strategies and a more balanced approach to communication channels. Additionally, the inclusion of a formal guest feedback mechanism and staff incentives would enhance the plan's comprehensiveness.",
