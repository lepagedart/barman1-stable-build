  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key compliance and operational strategies for a temporary gallery pop-up bar. It is clear and actionable, though it could benefit from addressing emergency protocols, local law variances, and insurance requirements. Simplifying the POS system recommendations and enhancing the feedback loop would improve feasibility. The tone and structure are mostly effective, but further conciseness and clarity could enhance understanding for all staff levels.",
