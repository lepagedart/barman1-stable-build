Title: Pop-Up Festival Bar (Unknown Utilities)

Tags: event, layout, throughput, compliance

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Build a resilient pop-up plan with contingency paths for power/water limits and strict ID controls.

Venue Context: One-day outdoor festival. Bar team of 8. Sales target 1,200 drinks in 3 hours.

Prompt: We’re running a festival bar and need a full plan: station maps, batching, ice strategy, ID flow, and a crush plan. Utilities aren’t confirmed yet—please call out what you need to know if it changes the setup.

Lloyd's Response:

To set up a festival bar that's efficient and ready to handle high volume, here's a comprehensive plan covering station maps, batching, ice strategy, ID flow, and a crush plan. I’ll outline what needs confirmation around utilities and how it might affect the setup.

### Station Map
```
[Station 1]  [Station 2]  [Station 3]
 Bartender   Bartender   Bartender
```
- **Station 1**: Closest to entrance for initial flow and ID checks.
- **Station 2 & 3**: Positioned centrally to handle peak orders.
- Allocate space for ice bins, pre-batch containers, and POS systems.

### Batching Strategy
- **Pre-batch Cocktails**: Choose 3-4 high-demand cocktails to pre-batch, reducing service time. Pre-batching should be done in large jugs or kegs if utilities are confirmed.
- **Batch Math**: Calculate based on expected foot traffic; aim for cocktails that use similar base spirits to minimize SKU load.

### Ice Strategy
- **Ice Storage**: Confirm if large ice storage is available or need to bring portable ice bins. Plan for frequent replenishment, especially in high temperatures.
- **Ice Allocation**: Use larger ice cubes or ice balls for slower melting if feasible.

### ID Flow
- **Designate an ID Check Area**: Place at entrance with clear signage and multiple staff to streamline the process.
- Consider wristbands post-ID check to avoid repeat ID verifications for multiple purchases.

### Crush Plan
- **Peak Time Staffing**: Increase the bartender-to-guest ratio during expected peak times.
- **Express Lines**: Consider setting up a separate express line for non-alcoholic beverages or pre-batched cocktails.
- **Queue Management**: Use barriers or ropes to manage lines and keep guest flow organized.

### Utilities and Contingencies
- **Utilities Confirmation**: Verify availability of electricity and water. If unavailable, plan for generators and water containers.
- **Backup Plans**: Have a contingency for each utility issue (e.g., portable power packs, additional bottled water).

### Action Checklist
1. **Confirm Utilities**: Verify electricity and water access.
2. **Batch Preparation**: Pre-batch selected cocktails day before.
3. **Ice Management**: Secure ice supply and storage solutions.
4. **Staff Training**: Conduct pre-event briefing on ID and service flow.
5. **Run a Mock Service Drill**: Simulate peak service to test setup.

Implementing this plan ensures a smooth operation tailored to the festival environment, even with the current uncertainties regarding utilities.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Safety and Compliance:** Address health and safety protocols, including sanitation stations and emergency procedures.
  - **Inventory Management:** Outline a plan for real-time inventory tracking to prevent stockouts.
  - **Customer Experience:** Include plans for customer feedback collection during the event.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Utilities Assumptions:** Avoid assuming utilities will be confirmed; provide a detailed contingency plan for each scenario.
  - **Batching Complexity:** Simplify batching strategy to ensure it is executable under festival conditions without over-reliance on utilities.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Develop SOPs for each station to ensure consistency and efficiency.
  - **Communication Protocols:** Establish clear communication channels among staff for quick issue resolution.
  - **Technology Integration:** Use mobile POS systems to facilitate faster transactions and integrate with inventory management.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Brevity:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Focus on actionable steps with clear responsibilities assigned.
  - **Prioritization:** Highlight critical tasks and decisions to guide focus during setup and operation.
