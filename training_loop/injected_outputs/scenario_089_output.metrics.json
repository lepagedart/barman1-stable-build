  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for reducing citrus waste. It includes practical steps for juice stabilization and peel utilization, which are feasible without lab equipment. However, it could benefit from more specific venue context and simplified processes for staff. The response aligns well with the goal of waste reduction but could improve clarity with consistent measurements and a more engaging tone.",
