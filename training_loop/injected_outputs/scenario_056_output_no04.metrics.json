  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable strategies for improving cocktail program profitability. The suggestions are feasible and align with the goal of maintaining guest satisfaction. However, the response could benefit from including a guest feedback mechanism and considering seasonal adjustments. Additionally, the tone could be more empathetic towards staff concerns, and the structure could be slightly more concise for better readability.",
