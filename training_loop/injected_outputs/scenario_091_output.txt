Title: High-Volume Rooftop Bar – Limited Prep Space

Tags: layout, event, high-volume, summer

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: layout_lens+event_lens

Venue Context: Seasonal rooftop bar, ~150 seats, single service well, minimal prep/storage area, mostly highballs and spritzes.

Prompt: How do we design the station and workflow to handle crush periods during rooftop season while keeping staff moving safely?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively manage crush periods during rooftop season, you'll need to design a station and workflow that optimizes safety and efficiency for your staff. Here's a structured approach:

### Station Map
- **Designate Roles**: Assign specific roles to bartenders to streamline operations:
  - **Bartender 1**: Service Well – Handles orders from servers.
  - **Bartender 2**: Guest Well – Focuses on walk-up guests.
  - **Bartender 3**: Floater – Assists both wells, manages restocking, and glassware.

- **Traffic Lanes**: Establish one-way lanes to minimize collision risks. Use floor tape or signage to guide staff flow. Consider a clockwise motion if space allows.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Keep frequently used tools (jiggers, shakers, strainers) and top-selling spirits within immediate reach.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Store less commonly used spirits and backup glassware.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Reserve for bulk supplies, extra ice bins, and less frequently accessed items.

### Build Path
1. **Glassware**: Retrieve glass, place on bar mat.
2. **Ice**: Scoop ice into glass.
3. **Spirit**: Pour base spirit.
4. **Modifiers**: Add mixers or modifiers.
5. **Shake/Stir**: If applicable, shake or stir.
6. **Strain/Pour**: Strain into glass or top with mixer.
7. **Garnish**: Add garnish and serve.

### Operational Notes
- **Par Levels**: Set daily par levels for spirits, mixers, and garnishes to ensure consistent restocking.
- **Restock Cadence**: Coordinate with barback for regular restocking intervals, especially during peak times.
- **Ice Management**: Ensure ice bins are regularly topped up to prevent running out during high demand.
- **Garnish Prep**: Pre-slice garnishes during slower periods to reduce prep time during rushes.

### 20-Minute Stress Drill
1. Simulate a rush period with staff performing their assigned roles.
2. Focus on maintaining one-way traffic and efficient build paths.
3. Use a timer to track drink preparation times, aiming for under 60 seconds per drink.
4. Review and adjust station setup based on feedback to enhance flow and safety.

By setting clear roles, organizing the station layout efficiently, and establishing traffic lanes, you can maintain high service quality and safety during peak rooftop seasons.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Customer Interaction:** Include strategies for managing customer expectations and communication during high-volume periods.
  - **Technology Integration:** Suggest using POS systems or mobile ordering to streamline order taking and reduce wait times.
  - **Staff Training:** Outline a training plan for new staff to quickly adapt to the station's workflow and roles.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Excessive Detail:** Simplify the build path steps to focus on key actions, avoiding unnecessary granularity that may overwhelm staff.
  - **Role Complexity:** Consider reducing the number of roles or combining duties to simplify operations and improve flexibility.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for staff to provide feedback on workflow efficiency and safety, allowing for continuous improvement.
  - **Inventory Management:** Use inventory tracking software to automate par level monitoring and restocking alerts.
  - **Emergency Protocols:** Develop clear protocols for handling emergencies or unexpected high-volume surges.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during busy periods.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Focus on direct, actionable language to ensure clarity and immediate applicability.
  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical steps and processes to prevent information overload and ensure focus on key actions.
