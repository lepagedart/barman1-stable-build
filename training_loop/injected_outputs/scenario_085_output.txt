Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Menu Across Three Venues

Tags: portfolio, menu_engineering, co_marketing, ops_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize supplier tiers/placements, cross-venue prep alignment, and measurable trade support. Include a 12-week rollout calendar and staff incentive plan.

Venue Context: Group with three distinct bars (hotel lobby, rooftop, neighborhood). Partner distributor offers support if we feature two portfolio SKUs in a seasonal menu.

Prompt: Propose a cohesive seasonal menu using the partner’s SKUs that still fits each venue’s style. Outline recipes, prep alignment, pricing, KPI targets, and distributor activation plan.

  - Implement monitoring tools to alert when the server is down or experiencing issues, allowing for quicker response times.

- **System Redundancy:**
  - Establish a backup system or failover server to maintain functionality during primary server downtime.

- **Communication Protocol:**

  - Provide clear instructions for users on what to do if they encounter an error, such as retrying later or contacting support.

  - Ensure Lloyd maintains a professional and empathetic tone in all communications, even automated error messages.
  - Structure responses to include a brief explanation of the issue, steps being taken to resolve it, and any immediate actions the user can take.
