  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides clear, feasible steps for implementing NA/low-ABV options. The response could benefit from more concise bullet points and a stronger emphasis on market analysis and customer feedback. The pricing strategy is consistent, but the integration with existing menu items could be more detailed. Overall, it's a strong response with minor areas for improvement.",
