  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for integrating Breakthru's portfolio. However, it lacks specific venue context and could benefit from more tailored financial metrics. The response is clear but could simplify language further to avoid jargon. Overall, it aligns well with the goal of maintaining a premium guest experience while meeting portfolio targets.",
