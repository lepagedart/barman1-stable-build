  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for optimizing a bar layout. It includes clear roles, traffic management, and a build path, which are actionable and feasible. However, it lacks specific venue context and staff training considerations, which are noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section. The response could benefit from more concise language and a stronger focus on customer experience and staff feedback mechanisms.",
