Title: Cafe to Bar Conversion

Tags: Efficiency, setup constraints, Menu design, venue alignment, batching

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: A coffee shop that becomes a bar after 4pm using the same counter and staff. No dedicated bar setup or ice machine.

Prompt: We’re running evening cocktail service out of our café. The transition is bumpy and we’re not profitable yet. I need a drink menu that makes sense for this space and workflow. What should I change?

Lloyd's Response:

To streamline your evening cocktail service and improve profitability at your café, focus on a menu that leverages existing café ingredients and minimizes the need for additional bar setup. Here's a practical approach:

### Menu Design Strategy

1. **Ingredient Cross-Utilization**:
   - Utilize ingredients already in your café, such as syrups, teas, and citrus fruits. This reduces cost and complexity.
   - Example: Use a house-made vanilla syrup from your coffee offerings in a Vanilla Old Fashioned.

2. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch spirit-forward cocktails to reduce service time and reliance on limited equipment.
   - Store them in your café fridge to simplify the transition to evening service.
   - Example: A Negroni or Manhattan can be pre-batched and served over ice with a quick garnish.

3. **Simple, Refreshing Builds**:
   - Opt for easy-to-make cocktails like spritzes or highballs, which require minimal tools and can be built directly in the glass.
   - Example: An Aperol Spritz using prosecco, Aperol, and a splash of soda water.

### Suggested Cocktails

1. **Vanilla Old Fashioned**
   - **Spec**: 2 oz Bourbon, 0.5 oz Vanilla syrup, 2 dashes Angostura bitters
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Rocks glass, large ice cube, orange twist
   - **Method**: Stir ingredients with ice, strain over fresh ice, garnish
   - **Cost Notes**: Low cost due to in-house syrup; target pour cost below 20%
 
2. **Negroni (Pre-Batched)**
   - **Spec**: Equal parts Gin, Sweet Vermouth, Campari
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Rocks glass, large ice cube, orange slice
   - **Method**: Pre-batch and store in fridge; pour over ice, garnish
   - **Cost Notes**: Efficient batching; target pour cost around 25%

3. **Aperol Spritz**
   - **Spec**: 3 oz Prosecco, 2 oz Aperol, 1 oz Soda water
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Wine glass, ice, orange wheel
   - **Method**: Build in glass over ice, stir gently
   - **Cost Notes**: Minimal prep; target pour cost around 20%

### Operational Notes

- **Batching**: Focus on cocktails that can be easily batched ahead of time. This reduces strain on staff during the transition from café to bar service.
- **Station Setup**: Use existing café equipment for cocktail prep where possible. One station with a basic setup can handle the evening service efficiently.
- **Staff Training**: Train staff to quickly transition from café to bar service, focusing on a few key drinks to maintain speed and quality.

By simplifying your menu and leveraging existing café ingredients, you can streamline operations and enhance profitability.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- Missing Pieces:
  - Did not address compliance with local alcohol regulations or licensing for evening service.
  - No mention of glassware/dishwashing capacity or impact on café workflow.
  - Lacks a system for tracking inventory or managing ingredient depletion between day and evening shifts.
  - No process for monitoring sales or profitability post-launch.
  - No mention of allergy/cross-contamination protocols for shared ingredients.
- System/Process Solutions:
  - Implement a daily checklist for pre-batching, inventory, and station setup/teardown.
  - Define a clear transition protocol between café and cocktail service (timing, responsibilities).
  - Set up a feedback loop (e.g., weekly review) to assess menu performance and adjust as needed.
  - Standardize recipe cards and prep sheets for staff training.
- Tone/Structure Guidance:
  - Use more concise, bullet-pointed operational steps for clarity.
  - Separate menu specs from operational guidance for easier reference.
  - Add a summary table for quick-glance menu and prep requirements.
  - Maintain a more neutral, directive tone—avoid "practical approach" phrasing; focus on actionable directives.
