  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for integrating bar program updates with digital systems. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise language. The feasibility is realistic, but the addition of integration testing and a guest feedback mechanism would enhance the plan. The structure is logical, and the actionability is strong, with clear steps outlined. The alignment with the prompt is consistent, though some suggestions in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section could be integrated into the main response for a more comprehensive approach.",
