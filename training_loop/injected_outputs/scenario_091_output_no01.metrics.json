  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive plan for managing crush periods during rooftop season. The clarity is good, though it could benefit from more concise language and bullet points for quick reference. The feasibility is high, as the suggestions are practical and actionable. The structure is logical, but could be improved with more concise sections. The actionability is strong, with clear steps and roles defined. The alignment with the prompt is good, though it could include more on customer interaction and technology integration as noted in the 'What Lloyd Should Have Done' section.",
