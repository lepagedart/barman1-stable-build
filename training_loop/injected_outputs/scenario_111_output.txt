Title: Multi-Property Hotel Group – Standardized Bar Playbook

Tags: portfolio, financials, technology, multi-location, training

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: portfolio_lens+financials_lens+technology_lens

Venue Context: Regional hotel group (8 properties: urban + resort). Mixed bar formats (lobby bars, rooftop, pool bars). Existing POS is Lightspeed at 6 sites, Toast at 2; basic inventory counts monthly; no unified spec book.

Prompt: Design a standardized, cross-property bar program that keeps local flair but unifies specs, costing, and reporting. We need: (1) a core cocktail list with allowed local swaps, (2) a pricing ladder and target pour cost ranges by market, (3) a POS/inventory integration plan that works across two POS vendors, and (4) how to leverage supplier portfolio incentives without locking out local heroes. Deliver a rollout plan and a 60-day training cadence.

Lloyd's Response:

To create a standardized yet flexible bar program for your hotel group, we’ll focus on balancing consistency with local character and optimizing operational efficiency. Here's a comprehensive plan:

### 1. Core Cocktail List with Local Swaps
- **Core Cocktails**: Select five signature cocktails that embody classic and popular styles. Each should have room for a local ingredient swap:
  - **Classic Margarita**: Tequila, Triple Sec, Lime Juice, Agave Syrup
    - Local Swap: Substitute Triple Sec with a regionally popular fruit liqueur.
  - **Old Fashioned**: Bourbon, Simple Syrup, Angostura Bitters
    - Local Swap: Use a local bitters or a unique syrup (e.g., maple if available).
  - **Negroni**: Gin, Campari, Sweet Vermouth
    - Local Swap: Swap gin with a local craft spirit.
  - **Mojito**: White Rum, Lime Juice, Mint, Simple Syrup, Soda Water
    - Local Swap: Infuse the rum with local herbs or spices.
  - **Espresso Martini**: Vodka, Coffee Liqueur, Fresh Espresso
    - Local Swap: Use a locally roasted coffee brand.

- **Execution Notes**: 
  - Batch core elements where possible (e.g., simple syrups) to maintain consistency.
  - Ensure each venue maintains a list of approved local swaps to simplify training and ordering.

### 2. Pricing Ladder and Target Pour Cost Ranges
- **Pricing Tiers**:
  - Urban Properties: Premium pricing to match market demand. Target pour cost: 18-20%.
  - Resort Properties: Slightly lower pricing to encourage volume. Target pour cost: 20-22%.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Conduct a market analysis to set competitive pricing.
  - Adjust based on local alcohol taxes and guest demographics.

### 3. POS/Inventory Integration Plan
- **POS Integration**:
  - Use existing Lightspeed and Toast systems to harmonize inventory tracking.
  - Develop a middleware solution or select a third-party app to unify reporting across systems.
  - Standardize product codes and naming conventions across both systems for clarity.

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Shift to bi-weekly counts to improve accuracy.
  - Train staff on input consistency and spot-check procedures.

### 4. Leveraging Supplier Portfolio Incentives
- **Supplier Strategy**:
  - Negotiate with suppliers to include local hero products in their portfolios.
  - Set up quarterly reviews to assess performance and adjust incentives.
  - Balance purchases to meet incentives without excluding local favorites by setting clear SKU limits.

### Rollout Plan and 60-Day Training Cadence
- **Rollout Plan**:
  1. **Week 1-2**: Finalize core cocktail specs, local swaps, and pricing strategy.
  2. **Week 3-4**: Implement POS updates and conduct initial staff training on systems and cocktails.
  3. **Week 5-6**: Begin new inventory procedures and integrate supplier incentives.
  4. **Week 7-8**: Monitor operations, receive feedback, and adjust based on initial data.

- **Training Cadence**:
  - **Initial Training (Weeks 1-4)**: Focus on cocktail preparation, POS use, and inventory processes.
  - **Follow-Up Training (Weeks 5-8)**: Emphasize consistency, troubleshoot issues, and adjust based on feedback.
  - **Ongoing Education**: Monthly sessions on local swap creativity and upselling techniques.

### Summary Checklist
- Establish core cocktail specs and local swaps.
- Set pricing tiers and target pour costs.
- Integrate POS systems for unified reporting.
- Balance supplier incentives with local offerings.
- Implement rollout and training plan within 60 days.

This approach ensures operational efficiency and allows each property to maintain its unique local flavor.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Missing Pieces:**
  - **Local Market Research:** Include a step to conduct a detailed local market analysis to tailor the core cocktail list and pricing strategy more effectively.
  - **Sustainability Practices:** Address sustainability by suggesting eco-friendly practices for sourcing local ingredients and managing waste.
  - **Customer Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for gathering guest feedback on the new cocktail offerings to refine the program continuously.

- **Overreach:**
  - **Complexity of Local Swaps:** Simplify the local swap process. Too many variations can lead to inconsistencies. Limit swaps to one or two key ingredients to maintain quality control.
  - **Supplier Incentives:** Avoid over-reliance on supplier incentives which might compromise the focus on local products. Ensure a balanced approach that prioritizes local partnerships.

- **System/Process Solutions:**
  - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Develop SOPs for cocktail preparation and inventory management to ensure consistency across properties.
  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a structured feedback mechanism for staff and guests to report issues or suggest improvements.
  - **Training Materials:** Create comprehensive training materials, including videos and manuals, to support the training cadence and ensure all staff are aligned.

- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**
  - **Clarity and Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.
  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use more directive language to clearly outline actions, e.g., "Conduct market analysis" instead of "Conduct a market analysis."
  - **Consistency in Structure:** Ensure each section follows a consistent structure: Objective, Action Steps, and Expected Outcomes for clarity and focus.
