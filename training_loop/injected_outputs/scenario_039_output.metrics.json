  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides actionable steps for managing service with limited staff. The focus on menu simplification and workflow efficiency is clear and feasible. However, it could benefit from addressing guest experience and staff training more explicitly. The suggestions for cost management and operational drills are practical, but the response could be more concise and prioritize immediate actions. The alignment with the scenario is good, but incorporating feedback mechanisms and technology utilization would enhance the response.",
