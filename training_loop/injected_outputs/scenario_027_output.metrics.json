  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a clear plan for efficiently preparing a banquet with limited resources. The batching strategy and prep essentials are practical and feasible. The action checklist is actionable, and the execution focus is aligned with the goal. However, the response could improve by addressing guest preferences, non-alcoholic options, and post-event evaluation. Additionally, including a timeline and contingency plan would enhance feasibility and actionability. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
