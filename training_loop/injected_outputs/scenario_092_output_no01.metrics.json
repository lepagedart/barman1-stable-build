  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key areas for designing a cocktail menu. It provides actionable insights and maintains a balance between profitability and guest satisfaction. However, it could benefit from including market analysis and guest demographics. The response assumes certain capabilities like batching and house-made syrups without assessing feasibility for all venues. Overall, it's a strong response with room for minor improvements.",
