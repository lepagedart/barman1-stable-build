  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and covers key aspects of the cocktail concept, including sustainability and operational considerations. However, it could benefit from more detailed sourcing and pricing strategies, as well as simplified garnish options for high-volume settings. The use of headers and bullet points enhances clarity, but further conciseness and consistency in terminology could improve readability. Overall, the response is client-ready with minor adjustments needed.",
