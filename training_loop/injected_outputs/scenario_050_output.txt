Tags: portfolio_matching, financials, supplier_relationships

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Call out quarterly review systems and supplier incentive tracking.

Venue Context: A regional hotel group is reviewing its liquor contracts and wants to maximize distributor incentives across five properties.

Prompt: How should we audit and align our cocktail menu with our distributorsâ€™ portfolios so we maximize rebates and incentives at scale?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively audit and align your cocktail menu with distributors' portfolios, maximizing rebates and incentives, focus on the following strategies:

### Financial Impact
- **Pour Cost Targets**: Ensure each cocktail aligns with your target pour cost, ideally below 22%. Use high-volume items from distributors to leverage better pricing.
- **SKU Rationalization**: Limit SKUs by focusing on versatile products that can serve multiple cocktails. This reduces waste and increases leverage with distributors.
- **Incentive Tracking**: Set up a system to track rebates and incentives on a quarterly basis. Ensure these are factored into pricing strategies.

### Supplier Integration
- **Quarterly Reviews**: Implement a quarterly review process with distributors to assess performance, update on incentive programs, and adjust menu offerings accordingly.
- **Contract Compliance**: Regularly check that your purchases are in line with distributor agreements to maintain eligibility for incentives.

### Operational Processes
- **SKU Mapping**: Map cocktails to distributor products to ensure each item has a clear purpose and aligns with portfolio goals.
- **Par Level Management**: Set par levels based on sales data and distributor agreements to avoid overstocking and ensure freshness.

### Staff Training
- **Brand Education**: Create modules for staff focused on the featured products, ensuring they can effectively communicate value to guests.
- **Upselling Scripts**: Develop scripts that help staff highlight the benefits of featured products, enhancing both guest experience and sales.

### Guest Perception
- **Guest-First Approach**: While focusing on distributor products, ensure that choices feel natural and aligned with guest preferences. Avoid making the menu feel like a sales pitch.

### Summary Checklist
1. Audit current menu items against distributor portfolios.
2. Adjust cocktail specs to meet pour cost targets and leverage distributor incentives.
3. Implement a system for tracking rebates and reviewing distributor agreements quarterly.
4. Train staff on key products to enhance upselling and guest engagement.
5. Regularly assess guest feedback to ensure menu changes align with expectations.
