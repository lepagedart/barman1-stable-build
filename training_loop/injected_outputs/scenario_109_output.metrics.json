  "notes": "Lloyd's response is well-structured and provides a comprehensive approach to ensuring cocktail consistency. It covers batching, prep, and storage effectively. However, it could benefit from more specific details on pre-dilution ratios and managing backup supplies to avoid waste. The addition of ingredient sourcing and feedback mechanisms would enhance the response. Overall, it is client-ready with minor improvements needed.",
