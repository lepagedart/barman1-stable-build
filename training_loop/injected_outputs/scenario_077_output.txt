Title: Sustainability Push: Reduce Ice & Citrus Waste at a High-Volume Cocktail Bar

Tags: sustainability, profitability, batching, prep_workflow, waste_reduction

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Apply Sustainability + Profitability lenses. Prioritize waste tracking, closed-loop prep, re-usable systems, and cost deltas.

Venue Context: Downtown cocktail bar, 220 covers on weekends, heavy citrus program, 600 lb/day ice usage; owner wants greener ops without slowing service.

Prompt: Build a 4-week plan to cut citrus waste by 35% and ice usage by 20% without hurting quality. Include clarified citrus/oleo/citric blends, frozen juice rotation (incl. reputable no-additive suppliers as contingency), melt management, batch sizing, and a simple KPI dashboard with weekly targets and savings.

Lloyd's Response:

To achieve a 35% reduction in citrus waste and a 20% reduction in ice usage over four weeks, here's a structured plan:

### Week 1: Assessment and Initial Changes
- **Inventory Audit**: Conduct a detailed audit of current citrus usage and ice consumption.
- **Staff Training**: Initiate training sessions on the use of clarified citrus and oleo saccharum. Introduce citric and malic acid blends for non-perishable citrus alternatives.
- **Frozen Juice Supplier**: Identify and establish a relationship with reputable suppliers like Perfect Pur√©e or Boiron for frozen citrus juice options.
- **Batching Setup**: Start batching high-volume cocktails using clarified juices and oleo saccharum. Limit batching to liquor-only components to ensure shelf life.

### Week 2: Implementation and Monitoring
- **Frozen Juice Rotation**: Implement a rotation system for frozen juice, ensuring it's thawed properly to maintain quality.
- **Melt Management Strategies**: Train staff on reducing ice melt by optimizing ice use during cocktail preparation and service. Consider using larger ice blocks for slower melting.
- **Batch Sizing Adjustment**: Adjust batch sizes based on sales data to minimize waste. Track how many batches are fully used versus partially wasted.

### Week 3: Fine-Tuning and Optimization
- **KPI Dashboard Setup**: Establish a simple KPI dashboard to track citrus and ice usage, including:
  - Daily citrus and ice consumption
  - Cocktail batch usage rates
  - Waste logs for unused citrus and melted ice
  - Weekly savings in terms of cost and volume
- **Weekly Targets**: Set weekly reduction targets based on the previous week's data to ensure consistent progress.
- **Feedback Loop**: Incorporate staff feedback on the new systems for continuous improvement.

### Week 4: Evaluation and Adjustments
- **Review and Adjust**: Evaluate the impact of changes on quality and waste reduction. Make necessary adjustments to batching and thawing processes.
- **Supplier Contingency Plan**: Finalize a backup supply chain for frozen juices to handle any disruptions.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use insights from the KPI dashboard to refine processes and maintain reductions. 

### Summary Checklist
1. Conduct initial audits and training sessions.
2. Establish frozen juice supplier and implement rotation system.
3. Develop and monitor KPI dashboard for citrus and ice usage.
4. Set weekly targets and adjust strategies based on data.
5. Evaluate overall performance and refine processes for sustainability.

This plan ensures a structured yet flexible approach to reducing waste without compromising the quality of your cocktail offerings.


What Lloyd Should Have Done:
### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

- **Clarify Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., bar, restaurant) and its operational scale to tailor the plan effectively.
  
- **Define Tags and System Mod**: Include relevant tags (e.g., sustainability, efficiency) and specify any system modifications needed for implementation.

- **Overreach in Supplier Selection**: Avoid prescriptive supplier recommendations without assessing venue-specific needs and existing supplier relationships.

- **Include Baseline Metrics**: Establish current baseline metrics for citrus and ice usage to measure progress accurately.

- **Structured Tone and Clarity**:
  - Use clear, concise language with actionable steps.
  - Avoid jargon and ensure all staff can understand the instructions.

- **Add Staff Engagement**: Incorporate a strategy for ongoing staff engagement and motivation, beyond initial training.

- **Risk Management**: Address potential risks in the plan, such as quality issues with frozen juices or staff resistance to changes.

- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a structured feedback mechanism, not just informal staff feedback, to ensure systematic improvements.

- **Continuous Monitoring**: Suggest a continuous monitoring process post-evaluation to maintain and further improve waste reduction efforts.

- **Simplify Summary Checklist**: Ensure the checklist is concise and directly aligned with the main action points for easy reference by staff.
