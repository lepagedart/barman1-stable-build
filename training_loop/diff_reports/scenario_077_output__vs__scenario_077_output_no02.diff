-- **Define Tags and System Mod**: Include relevant tags (e.g., sustainability, efficiency) and specify any system modifications needed for implementation.

+- **Define Metrics Clearly**: Clearly define what constitutes a 35% reduction in citrus waste and a 20% reduction in ice usage. Specify baseline measurements for accurate tracking.

 

-- **Overreach in Supplier Selection**: Avoid prescriptive supplier recommendations without assessing venue-specific needs and existing supplier relationships.

+- **Avoid Overreach in Initial Steps**: 

+  - The introduction of citric and malic acid blends and oleo saccharum should be gradual. Start with pilot testing to ensure staff adaptability and customer acceptance.

+  - Limit initial supplier engagement to one or two trusted vendors to avoid complexity.

+- **Enhance Staff Engagement**: 

+  - Include staff in the planning phase to increase buy-in and gather practical insights.

+  - Use role-specific training modules to ensure relevance and effectiveness.

 

-- **Structured Tone and Clarity**:

-  - Use clear, concise language with actionable steps.

-  - Avoid jargon and ensure all staff can understand the instructions.

+  - Avoid overly technical jargon to ensure clarity and understanding across all staff levels.

 

-- **Risk Management**: Address potential risks in the plan, such as quality issues with frozen juices or staff resistance to changes.

+- **Structure for Clarity and Actionability**: 

+  - Use bullet points for steps within each week to enhance readability.

+  - Clearly delineate responsibilities and timelines for each action item.

 

-- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a structured feedback mechanism, not just informal staff feedback, to ensure systematic improvements.

+- **Incorporate Feedback Mechanisms**: 

+  - Establish regular feedback sessions to discuss progress and challenges.

+  - Use feedback to make iterative improvements rather than waiting until the end of the process.

 

-- **Continuous Monitoring**: Suggest a continuous monitoring process post-evaluation to maintain and further improve waste reduction efforts.

-

-- **Simplify Summary Checklist**: Ensure the checklist is concise and directly aligned with the main action points for easy reference by staff.

+- **Plan for Long-term Sustainability**: 

+  - Develop a long-term strategy for maintaining reductions post-implementation.

+  - Consider environmental impacts and align with broader sustainability goals.
