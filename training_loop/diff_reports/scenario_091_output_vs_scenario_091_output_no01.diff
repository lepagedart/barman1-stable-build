 What Lloyd Should Have Done:

-[PLACEHOLDER]

+### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

+

+- **Missing Pieces:**

+  - **Customer Flow Management:** Address how to manage customer lines and wait times outside the bar area to prevent overcrowding.

+  - **Technology Integration:** Suggest using POS systems or ordering apps to streamline order taking and reduce pressure on bartenders.

+  - **Safety Protocols:** Include specific safety measures for handling glassware and spills, especially in high-traffic areas.

+

+- **Overreach:**

+  - **Role Assignments:** Avoid overly prescriptive role assignments without considering staff flexibility and individual strengths.

+  - **Stress Test Goals:** Setting a target of 60-70 drinks in 20 minutes may not be realistic for all venues; suggest tailoring goals based on venue capacity and staff experience.

+

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - **Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for staff to provide feedback on workflow efficiency and suggest improvements post-shift.

+  - **Inventory Management:** Introduce a digital inventory system to track stock levels in real-time, reducing manual checks.

+  - **Training Modules:** Develop modular training sessions focusing on specific skills like speed pouring and multitasking under pressure.

+

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to improve readability and quick reference during busy shifts.

+  - **Clarity:** Use clear, actionable language with specific examples (e.g., "Use red tape for no-stand zones") to avoid ambiguity.

+  - **Empowerment:** Encourage staff input and ownership of their roles by suggesting regular team meetings to discuss workflow improvements.
