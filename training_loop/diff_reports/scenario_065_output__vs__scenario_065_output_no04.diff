 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Staff Training:** Include a plan for training staff on new layout and procedures to ensure smooth implementation.

-  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a system for bartenders to provide feedback on the layout and suggest improvements post-implementation.

-  - **Equipment Maintenance:** Address maintenance schedules for tools and equipment to prevent service disruptions.

+  - **Staff Training:** Include a section on training bartenders to adapt to the new layout and roles, ensuring they understand the importance of each designated zone and role.

+  - **Feedback Loop:** Implement a system for bartenders to provide feedback on the layout and suggest improvements after initial implementation.

+  - **Safety Measures:** Address potential safety issues, such as slip-resistant flooring and emergency protocols.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Role Assignment Specificity:** Avoid overly rigid role assignments; allow flexibility for bartenders to adapt roles based on real-time demand.

-  - **Collision Controls:** Simplify collision controls to focus on key areas; too many controls can confuse staff and slow service.

+  - **Role Complexity:** Simplify roles to avoid overcomplicating the workflow. Consider combining roles if the volume allows, to reduce confusion and increase flexibility.

+  - **Excessive Detail:** Avoid overly prescriptive instructions on tool placement; allow for bartender preference within the framework.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Regular Audits:** Implement regular audits of the station setup to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.

-  - **Dynamic Adjustments:** Encourage dynamic adjustments to the setup based on nightly traffic patterns and specific event needs.

+  - **Regular Audits:** Schedule periodic reviews of the layout and processes to ensure continued efficiency and address any emerging issues.

+  - **Technology Integration:** Consider using technology, such as inventory management systems, to support the rail loadout and restocking processes.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during busy shifts.

-  - **Clarity:** Ensure each instruction is clear and actionable, avoiding jargon that might confuse less experienced staff.

-  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical actions or changes to focus on during the initial implementation phase.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for the action checklist to enhance readability and quick reference during implementation.

+  - **Clarity:** Ensure each section has a clear purpose and is directly actionable, avoiding jargon that might confuse staff unfamiliar with technical terms.

+  - **Empowerment:** Encourage a tone that empowers staff to take ownership of their stations and contribute to continuous improvement.
