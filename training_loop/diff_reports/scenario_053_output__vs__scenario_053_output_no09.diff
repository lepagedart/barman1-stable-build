 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Guest Experience Focus:** Include strategies for maintaining guest engagement and satisfaction during peak times.

-  - **Staff Training:** Outline specific training protocols for staff to ensure they are familiar with the new layout and procedures.

-  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a system for collecting feedback from both staff and guests to continuously improve the setup.

+  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue and expected guest volume to tailor the setup recommendations.

+  - **Staff Training**: Include a brief on training staff for the new setup to ensure smooth implementation.

+  - **Feedback Loop**: Suggest a mechanism for collecting staff feedback post-implementation to refine processes.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Complexity of Zones:** Simplify the reach zones to avoid overwhelming staff with too many categories; focus on immediate needs and essentials.

-  - **Detailed Pars:** Avoid overly detailed par levels without considering variability in guest numbers and preferences; suggest a flexible approach.

+  - **Detailed Equipment List**: Avoid overly prescriptive equipment placement without knowing specific venue constraints.

+  - **Mock Service Drill**: Recommend a shorter, more frequent drill rather than a single 20-minute session to allow for iterative improvements.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Technology Integration:** Recommend using POS systems to track inventory and sales in real-time for better par management.

-  - **Regular Review:** Implement a bi-weekly review process to assess the effectiveness of the setup and make necessary adjustments.

+  - **Digital Order System**: Propose integrating a digital order system to streamline communication between bartenders and servers.

+  - **Inventory Management**: Suggest implementing a digital inventory management system to track stock levels in real-time.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use direct, actionable language to ensure clarity and immediate implementation.

-  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical elements for immediate impact, such as staff roles and traffic flow, before detailing secondary processes.

+  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference.

+  - **Actionable Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly convey actions (e.g., "Assign roles," "Establish flow").

+  - **Clarity**: Break down complex instructions into simpler steps to ensure they are easily understood by staff.
