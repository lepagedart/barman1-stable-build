 What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

-- **Missing Contextualization**: Clearly specify the venue type and typical customer preferences to tailor the advice more effectively.

-  

-- **Overreach in Recommendations**: Avoid suggesting investments like battery packs without assessing the venue's budget constraints. Instead, recommend cost-effective solutions first.

-  

-- **System/Process Solutions**:

-  - Introduce a **Power Usage Audit** to identify and prioritize essential equipment and processes.

-  - Develop a **Power Outage Protocol** document to standardize staff responses and ensure consistency.

-  

-- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:

-  - Use a more empathetic tone to acknowledge the challenges faced by staff during power limitations.

-  - Structure advice in a priority order, emphasizing quick wins and immediate actions before long-term strategies.

-  

-- **Conciseness and Clarity**:

-  - Remove redundancy, such as overly detailed batching instructions, and focus on key actions.

-  - Simplify language to ensure clarity and immediate applicability for staff at all levels.

+- **Missing Pieces:**

+  - **Venue Context**: Clearly define the venue type and typical customer preferences to tailor recommendations effectively.

+  - **Power Supply Details**: Specify the extent and duration of power limitations to better align strategies with actual constraints.

+  - **Staffing Considerations**: Address staff capacity and skill levels to ensure recommendations are feasible with available human resources.

+

+- **Overreach:**

+  - **Backup Power**: Suggesting investment in portable battery packs may not be practical for all venues. Recommend assessing cost-benefit based on venue size and budget.

+  - **Manual Methods**: While useful, manual techniques should be a last resort. Prioritize solutions that maintain service quality without compromising efficiency.

+

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - **Dynamic Inventory Management**: Implement a real-time inventory management system to adjust batching and storage strategies based on current stock and demand.

+  - **Customer Communication**: Develop a communication plan to inform guests about potential service limitations and set expectations proactively.

+  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a process for collecting and analyzing guest feedback to continuously refine power-outage strategies.

+

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each recommendation is actionable and directly related to power constraints.

+  - **Prioritization**: Rank solutions by impact and feasibility to guide venues in implementing the most effective strategies first.

+  - **Empathy and Assurance**: Maintain a supportive tone, acknowledging the challenges of power limitations while reassuring venues of the effectiveness of the proposed solutions.
