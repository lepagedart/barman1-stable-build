 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Customer Flow Management:** Include a plan for managing customer flow and queuing to prevent bottlenecks.

-  - **Technology Utilization:** Mention the use of mobile POS systems or contactless payment options to speed up transactions.

-  - **Communication Plan:** Establish a clear communication protocol for staff to handle unexpected issues quickly.

+  - **Data Analysis:** Include metrics for tracking service efficiency, such as average wait time and drink preparation time, to identify bottlenecks.

+  - **Customer Feedback Loop:** Implement a method for gathering real-time customer feedback to adjust service on the fly.

+  - **Safety Protocols:** Outline safety measures for handling alcohol and managing crowd control.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Pre-batching Details:** Avoid over-specifying pre-batching without confirming venue capabilities (e.g., kegging).

-  - **Exact Ice/Mixer Totals:** Provide a range or formula for ice/mixer needs instead of fixed totals, allowing for flexibility based on actual attendance.

+  - **Menu Complexity:** Consider reducing the menu to two drinks to further streamline operations and reduce preparation time.

+  - **Teardown Plan Details:** Simplify the teardown plan to focus on critical tasks that ensure readiness for the next service.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time monitoring of inventory levels and customer wait times.

-  - **Feedback Loop:** Create a structured method for collecting customer feedback during the event to make immediate adjustments.

+  - **POS System Integration:** Ensure the POS system is optimized for speed and integrates with inventory management for real-time updates.

+  - **Role Flexibility:** Encourage dynamic role assignments based on real-time demand rather than fixed roles.

+  - **Inventory Alerts:** Set up automated alerts for low stock levels to preemptively address shortages.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical elements (e.g., staffing and menu) and then address secondary details (e.g., teardown).

-  - **Clarity:** Use clear, direct language to ensure all staff members can easily understand and execute the plan.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference during high-pressure service times.

+  - **Clarity:** Use straightforward language and avoid jargon to ensure all staff, regardless of experience level, can understand and execute the plan.

+  - **Action-Oriented:** Focus on actionable steps and clear directives to facilitate quick decision-making and execution.
