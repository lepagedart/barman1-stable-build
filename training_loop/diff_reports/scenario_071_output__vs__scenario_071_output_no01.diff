 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Customer Interaction:** Include strategies for maintaining quality customer interaction during high-volume periods.

-  - **Staff Training:** Outline a plan for training staff on the new setup and processes to ensure smooth implementation.

-  - **Contingency Plan:** Provide a backup plan for unexpected issues, such as equipment failure or staff shortages.

+  - **Staffing Plan:** Include recommendations for the number of bartenders and support staff needed during the rush to ensure efficiency.

+  - **Training Protocols:** Outline a training plan for bartenders to familiarize them with the new setup and procedures.

+  - **Contingency Plan:** Address potential issues such as equipment failure or unexpected demand spikes.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Complexity:** Simplify the station map and build path instructions to avoid overwhelming staff with excessive detail.

-  - **Assumptions:** Avoid assuming the availability of resources like additional staff or equipment without confirming their presence.

+  - **Overly Detailed Zones:** Simplify the reach zone descriptions to focus on practical, actionable steps rather than precise measurements that may not be applicable to all venues.

+  - **Excessive Steps in Build Path:** Streamline the build path to focus on critical actions, avoiding unnecessary details that could overwhelm staff.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Checklists:** Implement pre-shift checklists to ensure all items are in place and pars are met before the rush.

-  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a system for ongoing feedback from staff to continuously improve the setup and processes.

-  - **Technology Use:** Consider using technology, such as POS system integrations, to streamline order processing and inventory tracking.

+  - **Inventory Management:** Implement a real-time inventory tracking system to monitor stock levels and reduce restock frequency.

+  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Establish a continuous feedback loop with staff to refine processes based on real-time observations and suggestions.

+  - **Technology Integration:** Consider using POS systems that integrate with inventory and order management to reduce manual errors and improve speed.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Clarity:** Use clear, concise language to ensure instructions are easily understood by all staff members.

-  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical steps and components to focus on during the rush.

-  - **Engagement:** Encourage a collaborative approach by inviting staff input and suggestions for improvement.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference during busy periods.

+  - **Clarity:** Use simple, direct language to ensure instructions are easily understood by all staff members.

+  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Begin each bullet with a verb to emphasize action and implementation (e.g., "Assign," "Place," "Store").
