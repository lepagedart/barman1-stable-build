 What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

-- **Missing Contextualization**: Clearly specify the venue type and typical customer preferences to tailor the advice more effectively.

-  

-- **Overreach in Recommendations**: Avoid suggesting investments like battery packs without assessing the venue's budget constraints. Instead, recommend cost-effective solutions first.

-  

+- **Missing Pieces**:

+  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., high-volume bar, boutique cocktail lounge) to tailor recommendations.

+  - **Customer Experience**: Address how to maintain or enhance customer experience during power constraints.

+  - **Communication Plan**: Include strategies for communicating with guests about any changes in service due to power issues.

+

+- **Overreach**:

+  - **Backup Power**: Suggesting investment in portable battery packs may not be feasible for all venues. Recommend assessing cost versus benefit based on venue size and budget.

+  - **Manual Methods**: While useful, manual techniques should be a last resort. Emphasize maintaining quality and consistency.

+

 - **System/Process Solutions**:

-  - Introduce a **Power Usage Audit** to identify and prioritize essential equipment and processes.

-  - Develop a **Power Outage Protocol** document to standardize staff responses and ensure consistency.

-  

+  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a digital inventory system to track usage and adjust orders based on power availability.

+  - **Energy Audit**: Conduct an energy audit to identify non-essential electrical equipment that can be turned off or replaced with more efficient alternatives.

+

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance**:

-  - Use a more empathetic tone to acknowledge the challenges faced by staff during power limitations.

-  - Structure advice in a priority order, emphasizing quick wins and immediate actions before long-term strategies.

-  

-- **Conciseness and Clarity**:

-  - Remove redundancy, such as overly detailed batching instructions, and focus on key actions.

-  - Simplify language to ensure clarity and immediate applicability for staff at all levels.

+  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each point is actionable and specific.

+  - **Prioritization**: Rank suggestions by impact and feasibility to guide implementation.

+  - **Empathy**: Acknowledge the challenges faced by staff and management, offering support and understanding in the tone.

+

+- **Additional Recommendations**:

+  - **Staff Engagement**: Involve staff in brainstorming sessions for creative solutions, fostering a sense of ownership and teamwork.

+  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism to continuously improve processes based on staff and customer input.
