-  - **Conciseness and Clarity:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.

-  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use direct, action-oriented language to clearly convey steps and expectations (e.g., "Verify," "Ensure," "Implement").

-  - **Prioritization:** Organize steps by priority to guide the venue in addressing the most critical compliance and operational needs first.

+  - **Conciseness:** Streamline the response by merging similar points, such as combining signage and licensing checks into a single compliance review step.

+  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use more direct language to emphasize action, e.g., "Ensure," "Verify," "Implement," to drive accountability.

+  - **Prioritization:** Clearly prioritize steps by urgency or importance to guide the venue in focusing on critical compliance areas first.
