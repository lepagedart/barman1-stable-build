+- **System/Process Solutions**:

+  - **Technology Integration**: Suggest using mobile ordering apps to reduce line congestion and improve service speed.

+  - **Inventory Tracking**: Implement a real-time inventory tracking system to monitor supplies and prevent shortages.

+  - **Training Modules**: Develop specific training modules for each role to ensure staff are well-prepared and efficient.
