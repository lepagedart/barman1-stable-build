+### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

+

+- **Missing Pieces:**

+  - **Venue Context:** Clearly define the venue type and size to tailor the cocktail concept more precisely.

+  - **Guest Profile:** Include information about the typical guest demographic to ensure the cocktail aligns with their preferences.

+  - **Operational Constraints:** Address any potential space or equipment limitations that could affect the execution of the cocktail.

+

+- **Overreach:**

+  - **Complexity:** The use of a smoking gun might be too complex or impractical for some venues. Consider simpler alternatives that still offer a memorable experience.

+  - **Cost Management:** Provide a more detailed breakdown of how to achieve the target pour cost, including specific bourbon brands or alternatives.

+

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - **Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs):** Develop clear SOPs for the table-side service to ensure consistency and efficiency.

+  - **Training Program:** Implement a comprehensive training program for staff on the use of new equipment and presentation techniques.

+  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a system for collecting guest feedback on the cocktail experience to refine the offering.

+

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and focus on key actions.

+  - **Clarity:** Avoid jargon and ensure all instructions are clear and actionable for staff at all levels.

+  - **Engagement:** Use engaging language to emphasize the guest experience and the unique aspects of the cocktail service.
