 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

   - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Consistency:** Ensure all financial figures and percentages are consistently formatted for professional presentation.

+  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use imperative verbs to clearly direct actions (e.g., "Launch," "Monitor," "Implement").

+  - **Consistency:** Maintain consistent formatting for all sections, especially in cost card and rebate sections, to avoid confusion.

+

+- **Additional Recommendations:**

+  - **Visual Aids:** Consider using visual aids like charts or infographics in the FOH training materials to enhance staff understanding and retention.

+  - **Cross-Department Collaboration:** Engage with marketing and operations teams early to ensure alignment on promotional efforts and operational feasibility.
