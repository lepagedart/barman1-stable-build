 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - Include specific local regulatory references to ensure the plan aligns with jurisdiction-specific laws.

-  - Add a section on staff training frequency and certification requirements for compliance.

-  - Address waste management and environmental compliance related to beverage service.

+  - Include a section on staff training frequency and evaluation to ensure ongoing compliance and knowledge retention.

+  - Address the need for regular audits or inspections to verify adherence to compliance protocols.

+  - Provide guidance on handling customer complaints related to compliance issues.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - Avoid overly prescriptive measures like mandating UV light scanners without assessing cost-benefit and venue size.

-  - Simplify the incident escalation flow to focus on immediate actions rather than exhaustive documentation in minor cases.

+  - Avoid overly prescriptive measures like specific use of UV light scanners without assessing the venue's budget or existing resources.

+  - Refrain from mandating scripts for all interactions, which could lead to robotic service; instead, suggest key points to cover.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - Implement a digital system for batch logs and allergy information to enhance accuracy and accessibility.

-  - Establish a feedback loop for staff to report compliance challenges and suggest improvements.

+  - Implement a digital system for tracking batch logs and ID verification to reduce manual errors and streamline processes.

+  - Establish a feedback loop where staff can report compliance challenges or suggest improvements.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - Use clear, direct language to enhance understanding and implementation by staff.

-  - Organize content in a logical flow that mirrors the service process, from entry to service to incident handling.

-  - Avoid jargon and ensure all staff-facing materials are in plain language for ease of training and execution.

+  - Use a more collaborative tone by suggesting rather than dictating processes, e.g., "Consider implementing..." instead of "Develop scripts..."

+  - Structure the plan with clear headings and subheadings for easy navigation, ensuring each section has actionable steps.

+  - Include a summary or checklist at the end for quick reference by staff and management.
