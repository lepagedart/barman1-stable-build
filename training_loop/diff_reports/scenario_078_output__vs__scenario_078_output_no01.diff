 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Emergency Protocols**: Include a detailed emergency response plan for incidents beyond compliance, such as medical emergencies or security threats.

-  - **Training Program**: Outline a training schedule for new and existing staff on compliance, customer service, and emergency protocols.

-  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a system for collecting and analyzing customer and staff feedback to continuously improve operations.

+  - **Emergency Protocols**: Include a detailed emergency response plan for incidents beyond compliance issues, such as medical emergencies or security threats.

+  - **Training Program**: Outline a training schedule for staff to ensure they are well-versed in compliance, customer service, and emergency protocols.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Role Rotation Frequency**: Rotating roles every 10 minutes may be too frequent and disruptive. Consider extending to 20-30 minutes to maintain efficiency without causing confusion.

-  - **Real-Time Monitoring Tools**: Ensure the feasibility and availability of handheld devices for all staff, as this could be resource-intensive.

+  - **Role Rotation Frequency**: Rotating roles every 10 minutes may disrupt workflow and reduce efficiency. Consider longer intervals or role-specific rotations based on task demands.

+  - **Two-Touch System**: While ensuring compliance is critical, the two-touch system for every sensitive task might slow down operations. Implement it selectively for high-risk tasks.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Digital Signage**: Implement digital signage for easy updates and clear communication of compliance requirements and menu changes.

-  - **Automated Alerts**: Use technology to send alerts for low stock on wristbands or other critical supplies.

-  - **Compliance Audits**: Schedule regular audits to ensure adherence to compliance protocols and identify areas for improvement.

+  - **Digital Integration**: Incorporate a digital system for ID verification and allergen tracking to streamline processes and reduce human error.

+  - **Feedback Loop**: Establish a feedback mechanism for staff to report on the effectiveness of the playbook and suggest improvements.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use concise language and bullet points for easy reference during high-pressure situations.

-  - **Positive Reinforcement**: Include positive reinforcement strategies to motivate staff, such as recognition for compliance adherence.

-  - **Sequential Logic**: Ensure the playbook follows a logical sequence, from preparation to execution, to facilitate understanding and implementation.

+  - **Clarity and Brevity**: Use concise language and bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during operations.

+  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use imperative verbs to clearly define actions (e.g., "Position staff," "Place signage," "Verify tools").

+  - **Consistency**: Ensure consistent formatting across sections for ease of use, such as using the same bullet style and indentation for similar items.
