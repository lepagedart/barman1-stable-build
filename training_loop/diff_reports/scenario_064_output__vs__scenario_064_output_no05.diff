 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces**:

-  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., upscale bar, casual restaurant) to tailor the training to the environment.

-  - **Audience Analysis**: Identify the experience level of the staff to adjust the depth of training content accordingly.

-  - **Feedback Mechanism**: Include a method for staff to provide feedback on the training session to refine future sessions.

+  - Clearly define the target audience for the training (e.g., bartenders, servers, managers) to tailor the content accordingly.

+  - Include a section on handling customer objections or questions about tequila to better prepare staff.

+  - Provide specific examples of guest interactions to illustrate upselling techniques.

 

 - **Overreach**:

-  - **Training Duration**: Consider breaking the session into multiple shorter segments if 2-3 hours is too long for staff schedules.

-  - **Content Density**: Avoid overwhelming staff with too much information at once; prioritize key takeaways.

+  - Avoid overly detailed explanations of tequila production that may not be necessary for all staff levels; focus on key points relevant to service.

+  - Limit the number of signature cocktails to ensure thorough practice and mastery.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions**:

-  - **Pre-Session Materials**: Distribute a brief overview or video on tequila basics before the session to maximize in-person training time for practical application and interaction.

-  - **Digital Resources**: Create an online repository of training materials for ongoing access and reference.

-  - **Performance Metrics**: Develop metrics to assess the impact of training on sales and customer satisfaction.

+  - Implement a feedback mechanism post-training to gather staff insights and improve future sessions.

+  - Use digital tools or platforms for distributing educational materials and quizzes to ensure easy access and engagement.

+  - Establish a mentorship or buddy system pairing experienced staff with newer team members for ongoing support.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance**:

-  - **Engagement Focus**: Incorporate interactive elements such as quizzes or role-playing scenarios to maintain engagement.

-  - **Clear Objectives**: Begin with clear objectives for what the session aims to achieve, aligning with both staff and brand goals.

-  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each section delivers actionable insights without unnecessary detail.

+  - Use clear, concise language and bullet points for easy readability and quick reference.

+  - Incorporate interactive elements, such as quizzes or role-playing scenarios, to enhance engagement.

+  - Maintain a supportive and encouraging tone to motivate staff and foster a positive learning environment.
