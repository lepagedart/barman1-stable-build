+  - **Staff Training:** Outline a training plan for staff to ensure they understand and can execute the new setup efficiently.

+  - **Feedback Mechanism:** Implement a system for staff to provide feedback on the setup and suggest improvements.

 

 - **Overreach:**

+  - **Inventory Management:** Introduce a digital inventory tracking system to monitor stock levels in real-time and automate reordering.

+  - **Performance Metrics:** Establish KPIs to measure the effectiveness of the new setup, such as average service time and guest satisfaction scores.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Action-Oriented Language:** Use direct, actionable language to ensure clarity and immediate implementation.

-  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical elements for immediate impact, such as staff roles and traffic flow, before detailing secondary processes.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for all sections to enhance readability and quick reference.

+  - **Clarity:** Simplify language and avoid jargon to ensure all staff members, regardless of experience level, can understand and implement the guidelines.

+  - **Actionable Steps:** Begin each section with a clear, actionable step to guide implementation, such as "Conduct a team briefing before opening to assign roles and review the setup."
