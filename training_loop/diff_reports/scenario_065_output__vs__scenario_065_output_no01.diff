 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Staff Training:** Include a plan for training staff on new layout and procedures to ensure smooth implementation.

-  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a system for bartenders to provide feedback on the layout and suggest improvements post-implementation.

-  - **Equipment Maintenance:** Address maintenance schedules for tools and equipment to prevent service disruptions.

+  - Include a section on staff training for new layout and processes to ensure smooth implementation.

+  - Address potential challenges in implementing the new layout, such as space constraints or existing infrastructure limitations.

+  - Consider customer interaction and how layout changes might impact their experience.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Role Assignment Specificity:** Avoid overly rigid role assignments; allow flexibility for bartenders to adapt roles based on real-time demand.

-  - **Collision Controls:** Simplify collision controls to focus on key areas; too many controls can confuse staff and slow service.

+  - Avoid overly prescriptive role assignments without considering venue-specific staffing levels and bartender expertise.

+  - Refrain from assuming all venues can implement one-way traffic lanes without assessing space and current workflow.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Regular Audits:** Implement regular audits of the station setup to ensure compliance and identify areas for improvement.

-  - **Dynamic Adjustments:** Encourage dynamic adjustments to the setup based on nightly traffic patterns and specific event needs.

+  - Introduce a feedback loop with bartenders to gather insights and continuously improve the layout.

+  - Implement a regular review process to adapt the setup based on changing menu items or peak times.

+  - Suggest a phased approach to changes, starting with high-impact areas to minimize disruption.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during busy shifts.

-  - **Clarity:** Ensure each instruction is clear and actionable, avoiding jargon that might confuse less experienced staff.

-  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical actions or changes to focus on during the initial implementation phase.

+  - Use bullet points for clarity and to facilitate quick reference during implementation.

+  - Maintain a collaborative tone, encouraging venue management to tailor recommendations to their specific needs.

+  - Provide a summary section highlighting key benefits of the proposed changes to reinforce value.
