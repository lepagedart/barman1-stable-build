+  - **Inventory Management:** Incorporate a digital inventory management system to track ingredient usage and restock needs dynamically.

+  - **Continuous Improvement:** Establish a regular review process to refine the station setup and processes based on performance data and staff input.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Clarity:** Use clear, concise language to ensure instructions are easily understood by all staff members.

-  - **Prioritization:** Highlight the most critical steps and components to focus on during the rush.

-  - **Engagement:** Encourage a collaborative approach by inviting staff input and suggestions for improvement.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during busy periods.
