 What Lloyd Should Have Done:

-[PLACEHOLDER]

+### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

+

+- **Missing Pieces:**

+  - Include a section on **Market Analysis** to ensure menu offerings align with current trends and customer preferences.

+  - Address **Staff Training Programs** specifically for upselling techniques and customer interaction beyond storytelling.

+

+- **Overreach:**

+  - Avoid suggesting specific ingredient substitutions without understanding the venue's brand identity and customer expectations. Recommend a **customized ingredient analysis** instead.

+

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - Implement a **Feedback Loop** for continuous improvement, allowing staff and customers to provide input on menu items.

+  - Establish a **Digital Inventory Management System** to track ingredient usage and reduce waste more effectively.

+

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - Use a more **directive tone** in action items, specifying who is responsible for each task and setting clear deadlines.

+  - Structure the response to include **short-term and long-term goals**, providing a roadmap for implementation.

+

+- **Conciseness and Clarity:**

+  - Break down complex strategies into **step-by-step processes** to facilitate easier understanding and execution by the team.

+  - Ensure each section has a clear **call-to-action** to drive immediate implementation.
