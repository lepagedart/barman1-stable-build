 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Customer Flow Management:** Include a plan for managing customer flow and queuing to prevent bottlenecks.

-  - **Technology Utilization:** Mention the use of mobile POS systems or contactless payment options to speed up transactions.

-  - **Communication Plan:** Establish a clear communication protocol for staff to handle unexpected issues quickly.

+  - **Customer Flow Management:** Include strategies for managing customer flow and line organization to ensure the 6-minute service target is met.

+  - **Technology Integration:** Suggest using a POS system that supports mobile payments and order tracking to speed up transactions.

+  - **Training Protocols:** Detail specific training modules for staff to ensure consistency in drink preparation and customer interaction.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Pre-batching Details:** Avoid over-specifying pre-batching without confirming venue capabilities (e.g., kegging).

-  - **Exact Ice/Mixer Totals:** Provide a range or formula for ice/mixer needs instead of fixed totals, allowing for flexibility based on actual attendance.

+  - **Excessive Pre-Batching:** While pre-batching is efficient, over-reliance can lead to quality issues. Suggest a balance between pre-batching and on-the-spot preparation for freshness.

+  - **Glassware vs. Disposables:** The plan assumes a high volume of glassware use without considering the logistical challenges of cleaning and restocking during peak times.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time monitoring of inventory levels and customer wait times.

-  - **Feedback Loop:** Create a structured method for collecting customer feedback during the event to make immediate adjustments.

+  - **Queue Management System:** Implement a digital queue management system to keep track of orders and reduce wait times.

+  - **Real-Time Inventory Tracking:** Use an inventory management app to monitor stock levels in real-time and trigger alerts for restocking needs.

+  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a digital feedback mechanism for customers to provide immediate input on service and product quality.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical elements (e.g., staffing and menu) and then address secondary details (e.g., teardown).

-  - **Clarity:** Use clear, direct language to ensure all staff members can easily understand and execute the plan.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during busy service times.

+  - **Clarity:** Clearly define each role and responsibility to avoid overlap and confusion among staff.

+  - **Proactive Language:** Use proactive language to emphasize the importance of preparation and adaptability in dynamic service environments.
