 Lloyd's Response:

 

-To train your staff to upsell cocktails and premium spirits effectively without coming across as pushy, consider implementing the following strategies:

+To effectively train your staff to upsell cocktails and premium spirits without appearing pushy, focus on education, engagement techniques, and goal-setting. Here’s a step-by-step approach:

 

-### Training Focus

-- **Educate on Products**: Ensure staff is knowledgeable about the unique aspects of premium spirits and signature cocktails. This helps them speak confidently and naturally about the benefits and flavors.

-- **Use Storytelling**: Encourage staff to share engaging stories or interesting facts about the cocktails and spirits. This can pique interest without feeling like a hard sell.

-- **Interactive Training Sessions**: Conduct role-playing exercises where bartenders and servers practice upselling in a variety of scenarios, focusing on being attentive and responsive to guest cues.

+### Staff Training and Education

+- **Product Knowledge:** Ensure your staff understands the flavor profiles, stories, and unique selling points of premium spirits and featured cocktails. Use brief, engaging sessions to cover key points.

+- **Tasting Sessions:** Organize regular tastings so staff can personally experience the products they're recommending. This builds confidence and authenticity in their suggestions.

 

-### Upselling Techniques

-- **Suggest Pairings**: Train staff to suggest cocktails that pair well with menu items guests are considering. This approach feels more like a service enhancement than a sales tactic.

-- **Highlight Specials**: During interactions, staff should mention any current promotions or limited-time offerings. Phrasing like, "Have you had a chance to try our signature cocktail yet?" can be inviting.

-- **Offer Tastings**: If feasible, allow staff to offer a small taste of a premium spirit to guests, which can often lead to a full purchase.

+### Engagement Techniques

+- **Conversational Upselling:** Train staff to engage guests by asking open-ended questions like, "Are you in the mood for something refreshing or bold?" This approach helps guide the guest's decision without pressure.

+- **Storytelling:** Encourage staff to share interesting anecdotes about the cocktail's ingredients or the history of a particular spirit. This creates a narrative that captivates guests.

+- **Suggestive Pairing:** Teach staff to suggest cocktail pairings that enhance the dining experience, such as recommending a specific spirit that complements a guest's entrée.

 

-### Operational Integration

-- **Align with Service Steps**: Integrate upselling naturally into existing service sequences, such as suggesting a premium spirit as part of the initial drink order or when guests are seated.

-- **Set Targets and KPIs**: Establish clear goals for upselling, such as a target increase in check averages or specific sales of premium items. Track these metrics to provide feedback and motivation.

-- **Incorporate Feedback Loops**: Regularly review upselling performance and guest feedback. Use this data to refine training and recognize high-performing staff.

+### Setting Goals and Incentives

+- **Check Average Targets:** Set realistic targets for check averages and communicate these goals clearly. Provide individual and team incentives for meeting targets, such as bonuses or recognition.

+- **Role-Playing Exercises:** Use role-playing sessions where staff practice upselling scenarios. Provide feedback and highlight successful techniques.

+- **Regular Feedback:** Hold brief, regular meetings to discuss upselling successes and areas for improvement. Use these sessions to share tips and celebrate achievements.

 

-### Safeguards Against Pushiness

-- **Observe Guest Cues**: Train staff to read guest body language and verbal cues to gauge interest and comfort, adjusting their approach accordingly.

-- **Emphasize Genuine Recommendations**: Encourage staff to make suggestions based on what they genuinely believe the guest will enjoy, rather than just pushing the highest-priced item.

+### Summary Checklist

+1. Conduct product knowledge and tasting sessions regularly.

+2. Train staff on conversational upselling and storytelling techniques.

+3. Set clear check average targets with corresponding incentives.

+4. Implement role-playing exercises to practice upselling.
