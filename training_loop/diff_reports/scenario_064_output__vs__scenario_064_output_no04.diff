 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

-- **Missing Pieces**:

-  - **Venue Context**: Specify the type of venue (e.g., upscale bar, casual restaurant) to tailor the training to the environment.

-  - **Audience Analysis**: Identify the experience level of the staff to adjust the depth of training content accordingly.

-- **Overreach**:

-  - **Training Duration**: Consider breaking the session into multiple shorter segments if 2-3 hours is too long for staff schedules.

+- **Overreach:**

+  - Avoid assuming all staff will equally grasp complex tequila concepts; offer tiered learning paths.

+  - Simplify the upselling techniques section to focus on one or two key strategies rather than multiple.

 

-- **System/Process Solutions**:

-  - **Pre-Session Materials**: Distribute a brief overview or video on tequila basics before the session to maximize in-person training time for practical application and interaction.

-  - **Digital Resources**: Create an online repository of training materials for ongoing access and reference.

-  - **Performance Metrics**: Develop metrics to assess the impact of training on sales and customer satisfaction.

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - Implement a digital learning platform for ongoing tequila education and resources.

+  - Establish a mentorship program pairing experienced staff with newer team members for continuous learning.

 

-- **Tone/Structure Guidance**:

-  - **Engagement Focus**: Incorporate interactive elements such as quizzes or role-playing scenarios to maintain engagement.

-  - **Clear Objectives**: Begin with clear objectives for what the session aims to achieve, aligning with both staff and brand goals.

-  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each section delivers actionable insights without unnecessary detail.

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - Use clear, direct language with actionable steps for each training component.

+  - Break down complex information into digestible segments to enhance understanding.

+  - Foster an inclusive and supportive tone, encouraging questions and interactive participation.

+

+- **Conciseness:**

+  - Streamline the session structure to focus on essential elements, reducing the risk of information overload.

+  - Prioritize key takeaways in the summary checklist for quick reference.

+

+By addressing these areas, Lloyd can enhance the training's effectiveness, ensuring staff are well-prepared to represent the tequila portfolio confidently and align with brand goals.
