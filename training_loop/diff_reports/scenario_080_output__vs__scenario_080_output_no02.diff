 ### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

 

 - **Missing Pieces:**

-  - **Customer Flow Management:** Include a plan for managing customer flow and queuing to prevent bottlenecks.

-  - **Technology Utilization:** Mention the use of mobile POS systems or contactless payment options to speed up transactions.

-  - **Communication Plan:** Establish a clear communication protocol for staff to handle unexpected issues quickly.

+  - **Venue Context:** Include specific details about the venue layout and any potential constraints (e.g., space limitations, power sources) that could impact the setup.

+  - **Customer Flow:** Address how customers will queue and be served to ensure the line remains under 6 minutes.

+  - **Health & Safety:** Incorporate health and safety protocols, especially regarding handling of glassware and perishables.

 

 - **Overreach:**

-  - **Pre-batching Details:** Avoid over-specifying pre-batching without confirming venue capabilities (e.g., kegging).

-  - **Exact Ice/Mixer Totals:** Provide a range or formula for ice/mixer needs instead of fixed totals, allowing for flexibility based on actual attendance.

+  - **Pre-batching Details:** Avoid assuming kegging is always feasible without confirming equipment availability and venue permissions.

+  - **Staffing Flexibility:** While cross-training is beneficial, ensure that roles are not overly rigid to allow for dynamic adjustments based on real-time needs.

 

 - **System/Process Solutions:**

-  - **Real-Time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time monitoring of inventory levels and customer wait times.

-  - **Feedback Loop:** Create a structured method for collecting customer feedback during the event to make immediate adjustments.

+  - **Real-time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time tracking of inventory levels and customer wait times to adjust operations dynamically.

+  - **Feedback Loop:** Establish a mechanism for collecting customer feedback during the event to make immediate improvements if necessary.

+  - **Training Program:** Develop a concise training program for staff to ensure consistent service quality and efficiency.

 

 - **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

-  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference.

-  - **Prioritization:** Start with the most critical elements (e.g., staffing and menu) and then address secondary details (e.g., teardown).

-  - **Clarity:** Use clear, direct language to ensure all staff members can easily understand and execute the plan.

+  - **Clarity and Brevity:** Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and ensure key points are easily digestible.

+  - **Directive Language:** Use more directive language to clearly outline actions (e.g., "Ensure", "Implement", "Prepare").

+  - **Visual Aids:** Consider including diagrams or flowcharts for the station map and service flow to enhance understanding.
