-  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each section to improve readability and focus.

-  - **Action-Oriented Language**: Use more direct action verbs (e.g., "Ensure," "Implement") to convey urgency and importance.

-  - **Prioritization**: Clearly prioritize tasks to guide the client on what to address first, especially if resources are limited.

+  - **Conciseness:** Use bullet points for clarity and brevity, ensuring each point is actionable and specific.

+  - **Prioritization:** Order tasks by urgency and importance to guide the client on where to focus efforts first.

+  - **Client-Centric Language:** Use language that directly addresses the client, such as "Ensure you have..." or "Review your...," to make the guidance more engaging and actionable.
