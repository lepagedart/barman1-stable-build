+- **System/Process Solutions**:

+- **Missing Pieces**:

+  - **Risk Management**: Address potential risks, such as over-reliance on a single supplier, and suggest contingency plans.

 

-- **Strengthen Staff Training**: Expand on the training modules to include role-playing scenarios and regular assessments to ensure staff are confident and knowledgeable about Breakthru products.

-

-- **Integrate Guest Experience Focus**: Emphasize the importance of balancing supplier goals with guest satisfaction. Suggest ways to subtly incorporate Breakthru products into the menu without overtly pushing sales.
