 What Lloyd Should Have Done:

-[PLACEHOLDER]

+### What Lloyd Should Have Done:

+

+- **Missing Pieces:**

+  - **Venue Context**: Provide specific details about the venue size, expected guest count, and type of event to tailor recommendations more accurately.

+  - **Staffing Details**: Include the number of staff members available and their roles to ensure the plan is feasible.

+  - **Local Regulations**: Mention any specific local laws or regulations that might affect batching, serving, or waste management.

+

+- **Overreach:**

+  - **Batching Shelf Life**: Suggesting a 3-day shelf life without context might not align with all health regulations. Recommend verifying with local guidelines.

+  - **Reusable Garnishes**: While sustainable, ensure that the use of reusable garnishes complies with health standards.

+

+- **System/Process Solutions:**

+  - **Inventory Management**: Implement a digital inventory system to track usage and waste, ensuring real-time data for decision-making.

+  - **Training Module**: Develop a quick training module for staff on batching and compliance to ensure consistency and adherence to standards.

+

+- **Tone/Structure Guidance:**

+  - **Conciseness**: Use bullet points for each section to enhance readability and quick reference during setup.

+  - **Clarity**: Clearly separate sections with headers for batching, setup, waste, compliance, and drills to avoid information overload.

+  - **Actionable Language**: Use direct, actionable language to ensure staff can easily follow the plan without ambiguity.
