Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize batching and limited labor feasibility. Avoid high-concept builds unless they are fast to execute.

Venue Context: A 40-seat restaurant with a small L-shaped bar and only one bartender per shift. Menu needs to be prep-efficient, profitable, and executable without additional support.

Prompt: How do we build a profitable cocktail menu for a one-bartender bar while keeping execution simple and fast?

Lloyd's Response:

To create a profitable and efficient cocktail menu for a one-bartender operation, here’s a streamlined approach:

### Menu Structure
- **Limit the Menu**: Offer 3–4 cocktails to simplify execution and reduce complexity.
- **Use Familiar Builds**: Focus on recognizable cocktail families like Sours, Old Fashioned variants, and Highballs for ease of preparation.

### Cocktail Suggestions

1. **Classic Whiskey Sour**
   - **Spec**: 2 oz Bourbon, 0.75 oz Fresh lemon juice, 0.5 oz Simple syrup
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Rocks glass, ice, lemon wheel
   - **Method**: Shake all ingredients with ice, strain into a rocks glass over fresh ice, garnish with a lemon wheel.
   - **Cost Notes**: Target pour cost around 18-20%. Use house bourbon to manage costs.

2. **Gin & Tonic**
   - **Spec**: 2 oz Gin, 4 oz Tonic water
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Highball glass, ice, lime wedge
   - **Method**: Build in the glass over ice, top with tonic water, and garnish with a lime wedge.
   - **Cost Notes**: Simple build keeps costs low; aim for a 15-18% pour cost.

3. **Tequila Paloma**
   - **Spec**: 2 oz Blanco Tequila, 0.5 oz Lime juice, 2 oz Grapefruit soda
   - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Highball glass, ice, salted rim, grapefruit slice
   - **Method**: Rim the glass with salt, fill with ice, add tequila and lime juice, top with grapefruit soda, garnish with a grapefruit slice.
   - **Cost Notes**: Affordable with house tequila, target pour cost of 18-20%.

### Operational Notes
- **Batching Consideration**: Batch the sour mix (lemon juice and simple syrup) for the Whiskey Sour to save time. Store in the fridge with a shelf life of 1-2 days.
- **Station Layout**: Ensure all necessary tools and ingredients are within easy reach to optimize speed.
- **Training**: Ensure the bartender is comfortable with these builds to maintain speed and consistency.

This approach keeps the menu focused and manageable for one bartender while maximizing profitability and guest satisfaction.
