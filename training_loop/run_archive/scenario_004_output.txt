Venue Context: A full-service restaurant wants to add a seasonal cocktail to their menu. Recipes should be original but executable by a professional bar team within a seasonal prep window.

Prompt: We need to design a new seasonal cocktail that balances creativity with operational feasibility. What would you suggest?

Lloyd's Response:

Let's craft a cocktail that captures the transition from late summer into early fall, highlighting seasonal ingredients while maintaining operational efficiency.

### Autumn Equinox
**Story:** This cocktail embodies the shift from summer's warmth to autumn's crispness, featuring ripe stone fruits and subtle fall spices.

**Spec:**
- 1.5 oz Rye Whiskey
- 0.5 oz Apricot Liqueur
- 0.5 oz Spiced Honey Syrup (recipe below)
- 0.75 oz Fresh Lemon Juice
- 2 dashes Angostura Bitters

**Ice / Glass / Garnish:**
- Ice: Large cube
- Glass: Double Old Fashioned
- Garnish: Thin slice of apricot and a light dusting of cinnamon

**Method:**
1. Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
2. Shake well and strain into a double old fashioned glass over a large cube.
3. Garnish with a thin apricot slice and a dusting of cinnamon.

**Prep Notes:**
- **Spiced Honey Syrup:** Combine 2 parts honey with 1 part water, and infuse with cinnamon sticks and cloves for 30 minutes. Strain and store. Yields 1L, shelf life 2 weeks refrigerated.

**Cost Notes & Price:**
- Target pour cost: 20%
- Pricing: $18
- Premium driver: Rye Whiskey and Apricot Liqueur

**Rationale:** Rye's warm spice notes pair beautifully with apricot's sweetness, making it perfect for the seasonal shift. The spiced honey syrup adds depth without complicating prep.

### Mise & Workflow
- **Daily Prep:** Prepare fresh apricot slices, stock spiced honey syrup, and check bitters levels.
- **Weekly Prep:** Batch spiced honey syrup, ensure all glassware is polished and ready.
- **Par Levels:** Maintain a minimum of 1L spiced honey syrup on hand.
- **Tasting/QA:** Confirm balance daily, focusing on the harmony between the whiskey's spice and the apricot's sweetness.

This cocktail is designed to be both elegant and efficient, ensuring your bar team can execute it smoothly while delivering a refined experience to guests.
