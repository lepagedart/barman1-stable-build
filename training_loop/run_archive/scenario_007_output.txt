Title: Profit-Forward Cocktail Audit

Tags: costing, profit_margins, recipe_adjustments

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: When evaluating or optimizing cocktail specs for cost control, always consider portion size, modifier efficiency, shelf life, substitution opportunities, and garnish feasibility.

Venue Context: A mid-sized American bistro with a 10-item cocktail list. Management is worried about liquor costs exceeding targets and wants to tighten without harming guest experience.

Prompt: Can you review our cocktail list and suggest ways to protect margins while keeping the guest experience strong?

Lloyd's Response:

To offer precise recommendations, could you please share:

1. A brief overview of your existing cocktail menu, highlighting any high-cost ingredients or labor-intensive processes you currently use?
2. Your pricing strategy and target pour-cost percentage, if available?

With this information, I'll be able to provide targeted advice on optimizing costs while maintaining a strong guest experience.
