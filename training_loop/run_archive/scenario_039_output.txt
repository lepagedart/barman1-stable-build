Title: Late-Night Service with Limited Staff

Tags: workflow, staffing, guest_experience, menu_design, profit_margins

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Design for minimal labor: focus on quick builds, high-margin recipes, and simple service touches that still feel elevated.

Venue Context: High-volume music venue bar running with two bartenders post-midnight. Guests want fast drinks, but ownership doesn’t want to lose margin.

Prompt: We only have two bartenders covering 200 guests after midnight. Everyone wants drinks fast, but ownership still expects good margins. What menu and workflow changes do we need to survive these hours?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively manage service for 200 guests with only two bartenders while maintaining good margins, you'll need to focus on a streamlined menu and highly efficient workflow. Here's how you can achieve that:

### Menu Design

1. **Simplified Cocktail List**: 
   - Limit to 4–5 cocktails that utilize similar ingredients to reduce complexity and prep time.
   - Focus on highball and spirit-forward drinks that can be built quickly.

2. **Cross-Utilization of Ingredients**:
   - Use house-made syrups or infusions that can be used across multiple drinks to cut down on prep and SKU load.

3. **Batching**:
   - Pre-batch spirit-only cocktails like Negronis or Manhattans to speed up service. Store in the refrigerator and pour over ice or stir to order.

### Workflow and Setup

1. **Station Organization**:
   - Ensure that both bartenders have access to essential tools and ingredients within arm's reach (18-30" zone).
   - Use speed rails for the most frequently used spirits and mixers.

2. **Dedicated Roles**:
   - Assign one bartender to handle high-volume build cocktails and highballs, and the other to focus on more complex builds or guest interaction.
   - Implement a runner system if possible for glassware and restocking.

3. **Efficient Build Path**:
   - Set up a FIFO (First In, First Out) order at each station: glass → ice → spirit → modifiers → garnish.

4. **Reduce Garnish Complexity**:
   - Opt for simple garnishes that can be prepped in advance, such as lemon wheels or olives, to minimize last-minute tasks.

### Operational Notes

- **Cost Management**: 
  - Keep pour costs in check by choosing base spirits that offer good quality but are within budget. Aim for a 20-25% pour cost.
  - Regularly review sales data to identify best-sellers and adjust the menu accordingly to focus on profitable items.

- **Peak Service Drill**:
  - Conduct a mock service drill to test the setup, aiming for less than 90 seconds per cocktail during peak hours.

By streamlining your menu and optimizing workflow, you can maintain high service speed and good margins even during busy late-night hours.
