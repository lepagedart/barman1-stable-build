Title: Hotel Pool Bar High-Volume Afternoon

Tags: event_setup, workflow, speed_of_service, batching, guest_experience

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize throughput, heat/ice constraints, and drink durability. Avoid fussy builds—opt for scalable recipes and garnish discipline.

Venue Context: Resort pool bar serving 200 guests in afternoon peak. Hot weather, limited cold storage, and a single ice machine shared with banquets.

Prompt: Our pool bar melts down every weekend when 200+ guests hit at once. Drinks take forever, ice runs out, and garnishes spoil. How do we fix menu and setup so service flies and drinks hold up in the heat?

Lloyd's Response:

To streamline your pool bar operation and handle the weekend rush efficiently, focus on simplifying the menu, optimizing your setup, and ensuring drink ingredients are heat-resistant. Here’s a targeted plan:

### Menu Simplification

1. **Highball & Spritz Focus**:
   - Prioritize refreshing, simple builds like spritzes and highballs that require minimal steps.
   - Example: Aperol Spritz (Aperol, Prosecco, splash of soda) or Vodka Soda with a lime wedge.

2. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Pre-batch popular cocktails like Margaritas or Mojitos, keeping them in chilled dispensers to reduce ice dependency.
   - Use shelf-stable ingredients where possible to avoid spoilage.

3. **Garnish Efficiency**:
   - Use hardy garnishes like citrus wheels, which hold up in the heat better than herbs or delicate fruit.
   - Pre-cut and store garnishes in chilled containers with lids.

### Setup Optimization

1. **Ice Management**:
   - Invest in portable ice bins and schedule regular ice refills throughout the day to prevent shortages.
   - Consider using larger ice cubes for slower melting in drinks.

2. **Station Layout**:
   - Set up multiple prep stations to divide tasks (e.g., one for batching, one for garnishing).
   - Ensure well-organized speed rails with frequently used spirits in reach.

3. **Storage Solutions**:
   - Use insulated beverage dispensers and coolers to maintain ingredient temperature.
   - Label and rotate stock to manage spoilage and access quickly.

### Operational Notes

- **Staff Training**: Brief your team on streamlined service techniques and efficient station use. Encourage quick, consistent builds.
- **Prep Routine**: Implement a robust prep schedule to ensure all ingredients and batches are ready before peak hours.
- **Monitor and Adjust**: Track sales and stock levels to adjust menu offerings and prep needs dynamically.

### Action Checklist

1. Simplify the menu focusing on highballs and spritzes.
2. Implement a pre-batching system for key cocktails.
3. Optimize the station layout for quick access and minimal motion.
4. Upgrade ice storage solutions and schedule refills.
5. Train staff on efficient prep and service techniques.

By focusing on these areas, you can improve service speed and maintain quality, even under high volume and heat conditions.
