Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on pop-up ergonomics, batching math, and guest throughput targets. Build in contingency plans for glassware, mixers, and staffing.

Venue Context: Corporate holiday party with 500 guests at a rented loft. Temporary bar, limited back-of-house support, one shot at execution.

Prompt: Weâ€™re setting up a one-night bar for a corporate holiday event with 500 people. We need a plan that keeps lines down, feels premium, and avoids massive waste at the end. How do we design the menu, batching, and staffing flow?

Lloyd's Response:

For your corporate holiday event, the key is a streamlined bar operation that ensures quick service, premium feel, and minimal waste. Here's a tactical plan:

### Menu Design
1. **Focused Selection**: Limit the menu to 3-4 crowd-pleasers to keep service efficient.
   - **Classic Highball**: Whiskey Ginger or Vodka Soda with a premium touch such as an artisanal syrup or fresh herb garnish.
   - **Pre-Batched Sour**: A seasonal choice like a Cranberry Margarita or Winter Spiced Daiquiri.
   - **Signature Cocktail**: Create one themed drink that aligns with the event (e.g., "Holiday Sparkler" with prosecco and a berry liqueur).
   - **Non-Alcoholic Option**: Include a festive mocktail, such as a Spiced Apple Punch.

### Batching Strategy
- **Batch in Advance**: Prepare large batches of spirit-forward cocktails and sours. Store in labeled dispensers for quick service.
- **Portion Control**: Use consistent measurement tools (jiggers) to ensure portion control and minimize waste.
- **Shelf Stability**: Choose recipes with ingredients that maintain quality over a few hours (avoid fresh citrus in batch).

### Staffing and Flow
1. **Staff Allocation**: 
   - Assign a minimum of 4 bartenders to handle volume, depending on the venue layout.
   - 2-3 bartenders dedicated to pouring from pre-batched dispensers.
   - 1 bartender dedicated to non-alcoholic drinks and garnishing.

2. **Service Speed**:
   - Use a two-station setup for high-volume service.
   - Implement a clear FIFO (first-in, first-out) strategy for guests to maintain order.

3. **Guest Touchpoints**:
   - Include one or two roaming staff members to offer guests refills or take orders, reducing line congestion at the bar.

### Operational Considerations
- **Setup**: Ensure clear signage for drink options to expedite decision-making.
- **Inventory Management**: Monitor pour levels throughout the event to adjust batch amounts and keep waste minimal.
- **Feedback Loop**: Have a quick debrief with staff at midpoint to make necessary adjustments based on flow and guest feedback.

By implementing this plan, you can ensure a smooth, premium experience for your guests while keeping operations efficient and waste to a minimum.
