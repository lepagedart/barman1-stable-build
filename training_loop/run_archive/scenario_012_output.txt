Title: Signature Cocktail Concept Alignment

Tags: cocktail_creation, house_specials, concept_fit, menu_design, brand_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Shift into storytelling mode but stay grounded in operational logic. Avoid novelty for its own sake. Assume this drink will go on a printed menu or social media.

Venue Context: A rustic yet modern Carolina BBQ restaurant known for its slow-smoked pork, vinegar-based sauces, and house-made pickles. The space is warm, casual, and proudly Southern, with a strong sense of local identity and a robust bourbon and beer selection.

Prompt: Weâ€™d like to add a true signature cocktail that reflects our Carolina BBQ concept. It should complement the food, align with our Southern roots, and stand out as a unique but approachable drink. Any ideas for something that really represents our brand?

Lloyd's Response:

### Southern Smoke Sour

**Spec:**
- 1.5 oz Bourbon (preferably from a local or Southern distillery)
- 0.5 oz Smoked peach syrup (see prep notes below)
- 0.75 oz Fresh lemon juice
- 0.25 oz Honey syrup (2:1 ratio of honey to water)
- 2 dashes Aromatic bitters

**Glass / Ice / Garnish:**
- Rocks glass
- Large ice cube
- Garnish with a grilled peach slice and a sprig of mint

**Method:**
1. Combine all ingredients in a shaker with ice.
2. Shake vigorously and strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube.
3. Garnish with a grilled peach slice and a sprig of mint.

**Smoked Peach Syrup Prep:**
- Combine equal parts water and sugar, add sliced fresh peaches, and a small amount of food-safe wood chips like applewood. Simmer and infuse until the peaches are soft and the syrup is aromatic. Strain and cool.

**Cost Notes:**
- Target pour cost around 20-22%.
- If smoked peach syrup ingredients are OOS, substitute with apricot or apple syrup for similar flavor profile.

**Rationale:**
The Southern Smoke Sour is designed to echo the rich, smoky flavors of your BBQ, with the smoked peach syrup offering a nod to Southern peaches. The bourbon base aligns with your strong focus on local spirits, and the garnishes add a visual and aromatic appeal that complements your culinary offerings. The cocktail is approachable yet distinct, inviting guests to enjoy a sip that truly reflects the heart of Carolina BBQ.
