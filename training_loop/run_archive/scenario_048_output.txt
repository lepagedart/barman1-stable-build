Title: High-Volume Patio Bar Workflow

Tags: layout, workflow, speed_of_service, staffing

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Force ergonomic detail—stations, reach zones, collision rules.

Venue Context: A brewery with a 200-seat patio is adding an outdoor cocktail bar. Staff need to handle both walk-up guests and server drink tickets.

Prompt: What’s the best way to set up the layout and workflow for our patio cocktail bar so three bartenders can handle high volume without collisions?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize the layout and workflow for a high-volume patio cocktail bar with three bartenders, focus on efficient use of space, minimizing collisions, and maximizing throughput. Here’s a structured approach:

### Station Map
- **Designate Roles**: Assign specific roles to each bartender:
  - Bartender 1: Service Well – Handles incoming drink orders from servers.
  - Bartender 2: Guest Well – Focuses on walk-up guests.
  - Bartender 3: Floater – Supports both wells, restocks, and manages glassware.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Establish clear lanes for movement to prevent collisions. Use floor tape or signage to delineate pathways.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Immediate reach should include jiggers, commonly used spirits, and key tools (shaker tins, strainers).
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Less frequently used bottles, syrups, glassware, and garnish trays.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Backup stock and less-used items should be stored here to avoid clutter.

### Rail Loadout
- **Order Left to Right**: Organize the speed rail with most-used spirits on the left (e.g., vodka, gin, rum) moving to lesser-used ones.
- **Tools and Jiggers**: Place between the two wells for easy sharing.
- **Ice Logic**: Centralize the ice bin accessible to both wells; consider dual bins if space allows.

### Build Path
- **FIFO Order**: Standardize a build path to ensure consistency:
  1. Glass selection
  2. Add ice
  3. Pour base spirit
  4. Add modifiers
  5. Shake/stir
  6. Strain
  7. Garnish

### Collision Controls
- **One-Way Lane Rules**: Implement one-way movement paths, particularly around high-traffic areas like the ice bin and POS stations.
- **POS Placement**: Position POS systems away from major work zones to prevent bottlenecks.
- **No-Stand Zones**: Designate areas near doorways or essential equipment as no-standing zones to keep pathways clear.

### KPIs & Tests
- **Performance Metrics**: Track tickets per minute per well and average steps per drink.
- **Mock Service Drill**: Conduct a 20-minute stress test to evaluate and refine throughput and collision points.

### Action Checklist
1. Assign roles and set clear traffic lanes with signage.
2. Configure stations with designated reach zones.
3. Organize speed rail and tool placement for easy access.
4. Establish a standardized build path for consistent service.
5. Conduct a 20-minute mock service drill to identify and address bottlenecks.

This setup will help your team handle high volume efficiently while minimizing collisions and maintaining a smooth workflow.
