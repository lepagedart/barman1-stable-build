Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame menu through supplier partnership—each drink showcases a product. Include KPIs for measuring guest engagement and upsell strategies.

Venue Context: Downtown cocktail bar collaborating with a distributor for a one-month showcase. They want cocktails highlighting specific spirits while still appealing to guests.

Prompt: Our distributor is sponsoring a one-month menu. Each cocktail must feature a different spirit they supply. How do we design the menu so it feels authentic, drives guest engagement, and keeps our margins safe?

Lloyd's Response:

To design a distributor-sponsored cocktail menu that feels authentic, engages guests, and protects margins, here are the key steps:

### Strategy Overview
1. **Theme Integration**: Align the menu with a cohesive theme that resonates with your venue’s identity, such as seasonal ingredients or a regional focus. This adds authenticity and narrative to the menu.
2. **Cost Management**: Aim for a target pour cost of ≤ 22%. Use existing SKUs for modifiers and garnishes to avoid excess inventory.
3. **Guest Engagement**: Introduce interactive elements like guest voting for the favorite cocktail or limited-time tasting flights to drive visits and engagement.

### Execution Steps
1. **Cocktail Concepts**
   - **Signature Pairings**: Create each cocktail to highlight the unique characteristics of the sponsored spirits. Consider including a brief description or story that connects the spirit to the cocktail's flavor profile or theme.
   - **Flavor Balance**: Ensure each cocktail is well-balanced, using your kitchen’s strengths in fresh ingredients and house-made syrups or infusions where applicable.

2. **Menu Layout**
   - **Clear Sections**: Divide the menu by spirit type (e.g., vodka, gin, rum) to help guests navigate easily.
   - **Visual Appeal**: Use attractive, on-brand design elements and visuals to draw attention.

3. **Operational Notes**
   - **Batching**: Batch non-perishable components where possible to streamline service and maintain consistency.
   - **Training**: Conduct a brief training session with staff to ensure they can speak confidently about the spirits and cocktails, enhancing guest experience and potential upsells.

4. **Promotional Strategies**
   - **Storytelling**: Use social media and in-venue materials to share the story of the cocktails and the spirits’ origins or unique qualities.
   - **Guest Interaction**: Encourage guests to share their experiences on social media, possibly with a branded hashtag, to expand reach.

### Sample Menu Structure
- **Vodka Cocktail**: Light and refreshing with seasonal fruit and herbs.
- **Gin Cocktail**: Herbal and aromatic, highlighting your kitchen's fresh produce.
- **Rum Cocktail**: Tropical and vibrant, utilizing house-made syrups.
- **Tequila Cocktail**: Bold and citrus-forward, with a nod to classic Mexican flavors.

### Summary Checklist
- Develop cocktail specs with a focus on balance and profit margins.
- Design a visually appealing menu layout with narrative elements.
- Implement batching and staff training for efficient execution.
- Engage guests through storytelling and social media campaigns.

This approach ensures that the menu remains true to your venue’s identity, leverages the distributor partnership effectively, and keeps financial goals in check.
