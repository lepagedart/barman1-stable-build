Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on logistical prep and execution for one-off events. No long-term design talk.

Venue Context: A hotel hosting a 300-person wedding wants a temporary outdoor bar setup. Limited power, ice storage, and only 3 bartenders available.

Prompt: We need a pop-up bar for a 300-person wedding. What’s the most efficient setup for stations, batching, and service flow to keep lines down and quality up?

Lloyd's Response:

For a 300-person wedding pop-up bar, efficiency and quality are key. Here's a streamlined setup:

### Station Setup
1. **Bar Layout**:
   - **Three Stations**: Divide the bar into three stations—one for batching/prep, one for spirit-forward cocktails, and one for highballs/fizzers.
   - **Flow Design**: Each station should have a clear entry and exit point for guests, minimizing bottlenecks.

2. **Equipment**:
   - Use a combination of speed rails, ice bins, and garnish trays at each station.
   - Portable ice chests to maintain ice supply without needing a dedicated machine.

### Batching Strategy
1. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Focus on 2–3 signature cocktails that can be pre-batched to save time. Consider a classic Margarita and an Old Fashioned as versatile options.
   - Batch cocktails that don't rely on unstable ingredients like fresh citrus unless clarified or adjusted for shelf stability.

2. **Kegged Cocktails**:
   - If possible, keg still cocktails (like Negronis or Manhattans) to further speed service. This requires CO₂ or nitrogen setup for dispensing.

### Service Flow
1. **Staffing**:
   - Assign one bartender per station, with a floating barback to handle restocking and ice management.
   - Ensure bartenders are trained on the specific menu and batching processes.

2. **Guest Experience**:
   - Use signage to guide guests to the correct station based on their drink choice, reducing indecision at the bar.
   - Offer a small menu of 3–4 drinks to keep choices simple and the line moving.

### Operational Tips
- **Prep Time**: Allocate several hours before the event for batching and setup. 
- **Shelf Stability**: Ensure all batches are stored in coolers and consumed within the same day for optimal quality.
- **Waste Management**: Use reusable glassware or high-quality compostable cups to manage cleanup efficiently.

By focusing on a streamlined menu, smart batching, and efficient station setup, you'll maintain both speed and quality, ensuring guests have a great experience without long waits.
