Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame recommendations through supplier alignment. Call out profit and partnership benefits.

Venue Context: A mid-size restaurant group that exclusively purchases from Martignetti. They want their cocktail list to highlight products the distributor wants to push.

Prompt: How can we design a cocktail list that uses Martignetti’s portfolio strategically, so we get better pricing support and brand incentives while still offering a strong guest experience?

Lloyd's Response:

To design a cocktail list that leverages Martignetti’s portfolio for better pricing support and brand incentives, while maintaining a strong guest experience, consider the following strategies:

### Strategic Use of Martignetti's Portfolio

1. **Core Spirit Selections**: 
   - Identify key brands within Martignetti's portfolio that offer competitive pricing and incentives. Incorporate these as the base spirits across your cocktail menu to maximize volume discounts and promotional support.
   - Focus on versatile, high-quality spirits that can be used in multiple cocktails to limit SKU proliferation and streamline inventory.

2. **Signature Cocktails**:
   - Design 2–3 signature cocktails that highlight premium spirits from the portfolio. These can be positioned at the higher end of your pricing band ($22+) to enhance perceived value and justify the use of premium ingredients.
   - Example: Create a "Reserve Manhattan" using a featured whiskey from the portfolio, adding unique bitters and a bespoke vermouth blend.

3. **Brand Alignment**:
   - Work with Martignetti to understand any upcoming promotions or featured brands. Align your cocktail offerings with these promotions to capitalize on co-marketing opportunities.
   - Consider incorporating lesser-known brands that Martignetti is looking to push, offering guests something new while benefiting from potential introductory pricing.

4. **Guest Experience Enhancements**:
   - Ensure that every cocktail has a story or seasonal hook that can be conveyed by the staff, enhancing the guest experience.
   - Use quality modifiers and fresh ingredients to elevate the overall profile of each drink, ensuring guest satisfaction and repeat business.

### Sample Cocktail Concepts

1. **The Autumn Orchard**:
   - **Spec**: 2 oz apple brandy (featured product), 0.5 oz fresh lemon juice, 0.5 oz cinnamon syrup, 2 dashes aromatic bitters.
   - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Large cube / Old Fashioned / Dehydrated apple slice.
   - **Cost Notes**: Balance high-cost brandy with house-made syrup to stay within a 20% pour cost. Price at $18.

2. **Bourbon Harvest**:
   - **Spec**: 2 oz featured bourbon, 0.75 oz maple syrup, 0.5 oz fresh lemon juice, 1 dash Angostura bitters.
   - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Large cube / Rocks / Orange twist.
   - **Cost Notes**: Target pour cost around 22%; showcase bourbon to highlight Martignetti's portfolio. Price at $20.

3. **Low-ABV Spritz**:
   - **Spec**: 1 oz featured aperitif, 3 oz prosecco, 1 oz soda water, 0.5 oz fresh grapefruit juice.
   - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Cubed ice / Wine glass / Grapefruit wheel.
   - **Cost Notes**: Lower alcohol content ensures broad appeal and aligns with health-conscious trends. Price at $16.

### Mise & Workflow

- **Prep List**: Batch syrups weekly; ensure fresh citrus is prepped daily. Par levels for spirits should align with forecasted sales and promotional activities.
- **Tasting/QA**: Implement a daily tasting ritual before service to ensure consistency and quality.
- **Station Setup**: Organize stations by cocktail family to streamline service; ensure featured spirits are prominently displayed and easy to access.

By strategically selecting spirits from Martignetti's portfolio and aligning with their promotional strategy, you can enhance both your bottom line and guest experience.
