Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Assume the bar team is green. Avoid overly advanced prep or obscure modifiers. Prioritize training simplicity.

Venue Context: A venue without a strong cocktail identity needs a foundational cocktail menu. The goal is to launch a versatile, profitable, and staff-friendly bar program with broad guest appeal.

Prompt: We need to create a basic cocktail menu that is profitable, approachable, and easy for new staff to execute. Where do we start?

Lloyd's Response:

To build a profitable and approachable cocktail menu that is easy for new staff to execute, focus on simplicity, popular flavors, and operational efficiency. Here's a straightforward plan:

### Menu Strategy

1. **Core Classics**: Select 3â€“4 well-loved classics that have broad appeal and are simple to make. These should be familiar enough to guests and easy for staff to execute without extensive training:
   - **Margarita**: A popular choice that is easy to prepare and always in demand.
   - **Whiskey Sour**: Offers a balance of sweet and sour, appealing to whiskey lovers.
   - **Moscow Mule**: Refreshing and easy to assemble with vodka, lime, and ginger beer.
   - **Negroni**: A spirit-forward drink that adds a touch of sophistication.

### Execution and Operational Notes

- **Specs and Glassware**: Provide clear measurements for each cocktail and specify the glassware. For example:
   - **Margarita**
     - Spec: 2 oz Tequila, 1 oz Lime juice, 0.5 oz Triple sec
     - Glass/Ice/Garnish: Rocks glass, salt rim, lime wheel
     - Method: Shake ingredients with ice, strain into glass
     - Cost Notes: Keep pour costs around 20-25%, use house tequila for value

- **Batching**: Consider batching where possible to streamline service. For instance, pre-batch the Negroni in small batches to manage shelf life and maintain freshness.

- **Training and Setup**: Ensure staff have a quick training session to familiarize themselves with each cocktail's build. Set up the bar with all necessary ingredients and tools within easy reach to maintain service speed.

By focusing on these classics, you provide a menu that's both cost-effective and appealing, while ensuring your staff can deliver consistent quality with minimal prep and training.
