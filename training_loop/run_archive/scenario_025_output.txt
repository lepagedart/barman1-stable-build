Title: Speed Rail & Prep Station Optimization

Tags: speed_rail, workflow, efficiency, prep_efficiency

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Stay tactical. Think like a bar manager setting wells and rails for a high-volume night.

Venue Context: A nightclub with 500+ covers per night. Two wells with multiple bartenders working side by side. Guests expect quick service and simple cocktails.

Prompt: We want to optimize our speed rails and prep stations for maximum speed. What bottles and tools should live in the first rail, and what batching or pre-prep makes sense?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your speed rails and prep stations for maximum efficiency, it's crucial to strategically place your most frequently used bottles and tools within easy reach. Here's a streamlined approach:

### Speed Rail Setup

1. **Core Spirits**:
   - **Vodka, Gin, Rum, Tequila, Whiskey**: These are the most common base spirits and should be front and center.
   - **Triple Sec** or other frequently used liqueurs should be next to their compatible spirits.

2. **Modifiers and Liqueurs**:
   - Include **Vermouth**, **Amaro**, and any liqueurs used in multiple cocktails.
   - These should also be easily reachable but can be placed behind core spirits if space is limited.

3. **Bitters and Syrups**:
   - Store small bottles of **Angostura**, **orange bitters**, and your top 1-2 house-made syrups.
   - Use speed pourers for quick access.

4. **Juices**:
   - **Lime** and **lemon juice** should be in speed pourers or squeeze bottles.
   - If using fresh, pre-squeeze and store in labeled bottles.

### Tools

- **Shakers** and **strainers**: Keep these on the rail or within arm's reach.
- **Bar spoon**, **muddler**, and **jigger**: Essential tools should be easily accessible.
- **Ice scoop** and **tongs**: Place close to the ice bin.

### Batching and Pre-Prep

1. **Pre-Batched Cocktails**:
   - Consider batching spirit-forward cocktails like **Negronis** or **Old Fashioneds** to streamline service.
   - Store in labeled bottles and refrigerate as needed.

2. **Juice and Syrup Prep**:
   - Pre-squeeze citrus and store in airtight containers, labeling with prep date.
   - Batch syrups in larger quantities and store in squeeze bottles for quick use.

3. **Garnish Station**:
   - Organize garnishes in a caddy or tray, with common options like **lemons**, **limes**, **oranges**, and **cherries**.

### Operational Notes

- **Batching Log**: Implement a system for tracking batch usage, waste, and shelf life to maintain quality and compliance.
- **Prep Checklist**: Develop a standardized prep checklist to ensure consistency and efficiency during setup.

By organizing your speed rail and prep station with these guidelines, you can significantly enhance your service speed and streamline operations.
