Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Provide clear, numbers-based costing guidance using standard formulas. Balance financial advice with practical service considerations.

Venue Context: A mid-tier restaurant with a cocktail-forward bar program. Management wants stronger margins without alienating guests.

Prompt: How should we evaluate and adjust cocktail pricing and specs so that margins are protected while guests still feel good about value?

Lloyd's Response:

To effectively evaluate and adjust your cocktail pricing and specs, ensuring that margins are protected while maintaining perceived guest value, follow these steps:

### Evaluation and Identification
1. **Pour Cost Analysis:**
   - Calculate the pour cost for each cocktail using the formula: (ingredient cost per unit) × (volume used).
   - Aim for a target pour cost between 18-22%. Identify cocktails exceeding this range.

2. **Identify High-Cost Components:**
   - Review drinks with premium spirits, house-made syrups, or complex garnishes. Flag these for potential adjustments.

3. **Portion Size and Perceived Value:**
   - Assess whether portion sizes can be reduced by 0.25–0.5 oz without negatively impacting guest perception. Look for opportunities to maintain or enhance perceived value through presentation or garnish upgrades.

### Adjustments and Recommendations
1. **Recipe Adjustments:**
   - Substitute high-cost ingredients with more cost-effective options that provide similar flavors.
   - Simplify garnishes to reduce prep time and waste, while ensuring they still enhance the drink visually.

2. **Price Adjustment Opportunities:**
   - Consider minor price increases for cocktails with strong demand or unique ingredients. Ensure the increase aligns with market tolerance.

3. **Operational Efficiency:**
   - Streamline prep by focusing on shared ingredients across cocktails to reduce SKU load and speed up service.

### Implementation Plan
- **Pre-Shift Training:** Conduct training sessions to familiarize staff with any recipe changes and pricing adjustments. This will ensure consistency in execution and service.
- **Menu Updates:** Clearly communicate any changes to the menu, highlighting any new or improved offerings to maintain guest excitement.
- **Monitor Feedback:** Gather guest feedback on any changes to ensure that perceived value remains high and adjust as necessary.

These steps will help protect your margins while ensuring your guests continue to enjoy a high-quality experience.
