Title: Casual Restaurant without Dedicated Bar Manager

Tags: Inexperienced Bartenders, menu design, Training, implementation, Execution, perceived value, Lack of training program

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: Casual mid-sized restaurant with a neighborhood following. Beer and wine program is established, but the cocktail menu is basic and underperforming. No full-time bar manager — the bar is overseen by the GM, who also handles floor operations.

Prompt: We don’t have a bar manager and our staff mostly serves or pours wine. But I still want a cocktail list that makes money and isn’t embarrassing. Where do we even start?

Lloyd's Response:

Given your situation, we'll focus on building a straightforward, profitable cocktail list that's easy for your staff to execute. Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started:

### 1. **Simplified Cocktail Menu**
- **Limit the List**: Start with 3-5 cocktails. This keeps training manageable and inventory costs low.
- **Cocktail Families**: Focus on classic families like Sours, Old Fashioneds, and Highballs, which are versatile and well-known.

### 2. **Basic Equipment and Ingredients**
- **Essential Tools**: Invest in a shaker, jiggers, bar spoon, and strainer. These are minimal and necessary.
- **Core Spirits**: Stock versatile spirits like vodka, gin, whiskey, and rum. Choose mid-range options for quality without breaking the bank.
- **Standard Modifiers**: Simple syrup, fresh lemon, and lime juice are essentials. Consider pre-bottling these for speed and consistency.

### 3. **Cost-Effective and Simple Recipes**
- **Whiskey Sour**: A simple, classic choice that’s easy to make.
  - **Spec**: 2 oz whiskey, 0.75 oz lemon juice, 0.75 oz simple syrup.
  - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Shake with ice, strain into a rocks glass with fresh ice, garnish with a lemon wheel.
  - **Cost Notes**: Aim for a 20% pour cost by using house whiskey; consider batching lemon juice and syrup for consistency.

- **Gin & Tonic**: Easy to execute with minimal training.
  - **Spec**: 2 oz gin, top with tonic water.
  - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Build over ice in a highball glass, garnish with a lime wedge.
  - **Cost Notes**: Use a mid-range gin for balance between cost and flavor.

- **Rum Punch**: Offers a bit of flair while being simple.
  - **Spec**: 1.5 oz rum, 1 oz pineapple juice, 1 oz orange juice, 0.5 oz grenadine.
  - **Ice / Glass / Garnish**: Shake with ice, strain into a rocks glass, garnish with a cherry or orange slice.
  - **Cost Notes**: Pre-batch juices to reduce prep time and waste.

### 4. **Operational Tips**
- **Batching**: Consider batching non-carbonated components to reduce service time.
- **Training**: A short training session focusing on consistent measures and techniques will help staff feel confident.

### 5. **Guest Experience**
- Ensure the drinks are visually appealing with simple garnishes.
- Keep presentation clean and neat to avoid any errors due to lack of experience.

By focusing on these basics, you can create a profitable and respectable cocktail list that your team can manage.
