Title: Neighborhood Lounge – Consistency & Recovery Playbook

Tags: guest_experience, consistency, layout, financials, training

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: guest_experience_lens+layout_lens+financials_lens

Venue Context: 70-seat cocktail lounge with a single service well and a short rail. Guest reviews mention 'too sweet', 'inconsistent', and slow remakes on weekends. One bartender + one barback on peak nights.

Prompt: Create a guest-experience recovery playbook and a consistency toolkit. We need: (1) calibration standards for citrus/syrup and a jigger compliance routine, (2) a quick-fix matrix for common send-backs (too sweet/sour/watery), (3) a station map + reach zones that speed remakes, and (4) a comp/manager-touch policy that controls cost but earns back trust.

### Guest-Experience Recovery Playbook

#### 1. Calibration and Consistency Toolkit

**Citrus/Syrup Calibration:**
- **Daily Calibration**: 
  - Taste all citrus juices and syrups during setup.
  - Adjust recipes based on sweetness and acidity (e.g., if lemon is too tart, slightly reduce quantity or increase simple syrup).
  - Document any adjustments for staff reference.

**Jigger Compliance Routine:**
- **Weekly Training**:
  - Conduct a 15-minute jigger pouring exercise at the start of each week.
  - Use water to minimize waste; aim for consistent pours each time.
  - Spot checks during service to ensure compliance.

#### 2. Quick-Fix Matrix for Common Send-Backs

- **Too Sweet**: 
  - Add a dash of lemon or lime juice to balance.
  - Stir and taste before returning to the guest.

- **Too Sour**: 
  - Add a small amount of simple syrup or a sweeter modifier like St. Germain.
  - Stir and taste before returning to the guest.

- **Too Watery**: 
  - Shake again with fresh ice to reinvigorate the dilution balance.
  - Optionally add a small splash of fresh base spirit if needed.

#### 3. Station Map + Reach Zones

**Station Layout:**
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Frequently used tools (jiggers, bar spoons), bitters, salt/sugar rimmer.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Spirits, syrups, citrus juices, and smallware.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Garnishes, less frequently used modifiers, and additional glassware.

**Speed Strategy:**
- Place the dump sink centrally for quick access.
- Organize the rail by frequency of use (e.g., vodka, gin, tequila, rum, whiskey).

#### 4. Comp/Manager-Touch Policy

**Compensation Guidelines:**
- **Comp Criteria**: 
  - Only comp when the guest is visibly dissatisfied and a remake doesn’t resolve the issue.
  - Offer a complimentary small appetizer or dessert as an alternative to a drink comp.

**Manager Touchpoints:**
- **Engagement**: 
  - Managers should approach tables when a comp is issued.
  - Offer a sincere apology and a brief explanation of the correction.

**Cost Control:**
- Track comps in the POS with a reason code for monthly review.
- Focus on learning from patterns to reduce future send-backs.

### Summary Checklist

1. Implement daily citrus/syrup calibration and weekly jigger training.
2. Use the Quick-Fix Matrix for immediate response to guest feedback.
3. Reorganize the station map for efficient access and reduced remake times.
4. Develop a comp policy that supports guest satisfaction while controlling costs.

### 20-Minute Mock Service Drill

1. **Setup**: Organize the bar station following the new layout.
2. **Calibration**: Conduct a citrus/syrup calibration session.
3. **Training**: Run a jigger compliance routine with the bar team.
4. **Scenario**: Simulate send-back scenarios using the Quick-Fix Matrix.
5. **Review**: Have a manager conduct a mock comp scenario for training. 

Implementing this playbook should enhance guest satisfaction, improve drink consistency, and manage costs effectively.
