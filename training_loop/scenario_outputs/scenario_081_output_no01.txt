Title: Saturday Night POS Outage — Keep Service Moving

Tags: technology, ops, speed_of_service, cash_handling, risk

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on offline workflows, redundancy, and reconciliation. Include device & network triage, paper ticket flow, cash/IOU protocol, and end-of-night data merge.

Venue Context: High-volume neighborhood cocktail bar (220 covers, 2 stations, 1 service well), peak Saturday 9–11pm. POS went down mid-service.

Prompt: Our POS died during peak and support ETA is hours. How do we keep taking orders, maintain accuracy, control cash/cards, and reconcile later without wrecking the guest experience?

Lloyd's Response:

Here's a practical approach to manage orders and payments effectively while your POS is down:

### Order Taking
- **Paper Tickets**: Use order pads or plain paper to take orders. Assign a runner to collect orders from servers and bring them to the bar if needed.
- **Clear Communication**: Train staff to clearly communicate orders to the bar team to reduce confusion. Use standardized abbreviations for consistency.

### Payment Handling
- **Cash Transactions**: Set up a cash box and ensure a manager or trusted staff member handles cash to prevent discrepancies. Keep a simple log of cash received, noting table numbers and amounts.
- **Credit Card Processing**: Use a manual card imprinter if available, or take a photo of the card (with guest consent) for later input. Ensure all sensitive information is securely stored and handled.

### Reconciliation and Accuracy
- **Order Log**: Maintain a clear log of all orders with table numbers, guest names, and timestamps. This will aid in later reconciliation.
- **End of Shift Reconciliation**: At the end of the shift, compare cash and manual credit card slips against the order log to ensure accuracy. Make notes of any discrepancies for follow-up once the POS is operational.

### Guest Experience
- **Transparent Communication**: Inform guests about the situation and apologize for any inconvenience. Keep them updated and thank them for their patience.
- **Speed and Service**: Focus on maintaining speed and quality of service to offset any potential frustration from the process change.

### Checklist Summary
1. **Prepare order pads and assign a runner.**
2. **Set up a cash handling protocol and credit card capture method.**
3. **Keep a detailed order log for later reconciliation.**
4. **Communicate with guests about the delay and offer updates.**
5. **Reconcile orders and payments at shift's end.**

By keeping operations organized and transparent, you can manage the disruption with minimal impact on the guest experience and ensure accurate reconciliation once your POS is back online.
