Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Menu With Cost Guardrails

Tags: portfolio, profitability, menu_engineering, supplier_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Activate Portfolio + Profitability lenses. Tie features to supplier priorities, rebates, and margin floors.

Venue Context: Neighborhood restaurant bar, 14 taps, 10 cocktails. Two distributors offer co-op dollars if we feature 3 SKUs each and meet quarterly case goals.

Prompt: Draft a seasonal menu plan that aligns with two distributorsâ€™ priority SKUs while protecting a 78% beverage margin target. Include: SKU selections with rationale, cost cards, rebate/co-op accounting, staff spiffs, and a 6-week rotation calendar. Add a one-pager for FOH training and a simple scorecard to track sell-through vs goals.

Lloyd's Response:

To create a seasonal menu plan that aligns with distributor priorities while maintaining a 78% beverage margin, here's a structured approach:

### SKU Selection & Rationale
1. **Distributor A Priority SKU**: 
   - **Vodka Brand X**: Widely recognized with strategic pricing incentives. 
   - **Rationale**: Vodka is versatile and can be featured in multiple cocktails; distributor offers a rebate on volume purchases.
   
2. **Distributor B Priority SKU**: 
   - **Gin Brand Y**: Premium brand with a strong market presence.
   - **Rationale**: Fits into classic and modern cocktail profiles; co-op marketing funds available to support promotions.

### Menu Design
- **Vodka-Focused Cocktail**: Seasonal Vodka Mule
  - Cost-effective mixers and garnishes to maximize margin.
- **Gin-Focused Cocktail**: Autumnal Gin & Tonic
  - Utilizes seasonal botanicals or garnishes to elevate experience.

### Cost Cards
- **Vodka Mule**: 
  - Vodka Brand X: $0.50 per 1 oz
  - Ginger Beer: $0.20 per 4 oz
  - Lime Juice: $0.05
  - Garnish: Mint Sprig: $0.10
  - **Total Cost**: $0.85
  - **Menu Price**: $10.00 (78.5% margin)

- **Autumnal Gin & Tonic**:

  - Tonic Water: $0.15 per 4 oz

### Rebate/Co-op Accounting
- **Vodka Brand X**: $200 rebate after 100 bottles.
- **Gin Brand Y**: $150 co-op fund for promotional materials.

### Staff Spiffs
- **Incentive Program**: $5 for every 20 Vodka Mules or Autumnal Gin & Tonics sold.
- **Objective**: Encourage staff engagement and upselling.

### 6-Week Rotation Calendar
- **Weeks 1-2**: Launch Vodka Mule with promotional push.
- **Weeks 3-4**: Focus on Autumnal Gin & Tonic, leveraging co-op marketing.
- **Weeks 5-6**: Highlight both cocktails with a "Seasonal Pairing" offer.

### FOH Training One-Pager
- **Cocktail Profiles**: Key flavor notes and suggested pairings.
- **Talking Points**: Brand stories and unique selling points.
- **Upsell Techniques**: Encourage guest interaction and customization.

### Scorecard for Sell-Through
- **Metrics**: Number of each cocktail sold vs target.
- **Weekly Review**: Adjust incentives or promotions based on performance.
- **Feedback Loop**: Gather staff input on guest preferences and menu reception.

### Summary Checklist
1. Set up distributor meetings to confirm rebates and co-op funds.
2. Print cost cards and distribute to bar staff.
3. Implement FOH training and provide staff spiff details.
4. Launch initial promotions according to the calendar.
