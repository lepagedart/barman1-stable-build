Title: Zero-Waste Garnish & Juice Program

Tags: sustainability, prep, batching, inventory, costing

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize yield tracking, repurposing byproducts, freezing strategy, and safe shelf-life. Include a weekly zero-waste scorecard and staff prep checklists.

Venue Context: Craft cocktail bar producing 25L citrus weekly with variable fruit quality; limited cold storage; team wants greener practices without slowing service.

Prompt: Design a zero-waste juice and garnish workflow: how to capture peels/pith/pulp, stabilize juice, pre-batch efficiently, and measure savings without sacrificing quality.

Lloyd's Response:

To establish a zero-waste juice and garnish workflow that captures peels, pith, and pulp while stabilizing juice, follow these steps:

### Juice Stabilization and Pre-Batching
1. **Citrus Juice Stabilization**:
   - Use a combination of citric and malic acids to create a stabilized juice solution. This helps maintain acidity and freshness over time.
   - Consider clarifying juices using agar or a centrifuge to remove solids, extending shelf life and improving clarity.

2. **Pre-Batching Juices**:
   - Batch juices in advance for high-volume cocktails. Store in airtight containers and label with the preparation date.
   - Use vacuum sealing where possible to prevent oxidation and extend shelf life.

### Garnish Utilization
1. **Peel Utilization**:
   - Zest citrus fruits before juicing. Use peels for infusions or to make oleo saccharum by macerating with sugar, which can be used as a sweetener.
   - Dehydrate peels for use as garnishes or ground into citrus powders.

2. **Pith and Pulp Utilization**:
   - Use leftover pulp in syrups or marmalades, adding a unique flavor dimension to cocktails.
   - Compost pith and other non-utilized organic matter to minimize waste.

### Waste Measurement and Savings
1. **Tracking and Reporting**:
   - Implement a waste log to record the amount of citrus and garnishes used, and track reductions over time.
   - Regularly review inventory and sales to measure the impact on cost savings and reduced waste.

2. **Cost Analysis**:
   - Calculate cost savings by comparing the cost of whole citrus versus stabilized solutions and pre-batched components over a defined period.
   - Use POS data to analyze sales trends and adjust the workflow to ensure it aligns with demand and minimizes excess prep.

### Operational Notes
- **Training**: Ensure staff are trained on the new processes, emphasizing the importance of zero-waste practices.
- **Quality Checks**: Regularly taste batches to ensure quality and consistency. Adjust acid or sugar levels as needed.

By implementing these strategies, you can effectively minimize waste and measure cost savings without sacrificing the quality of your cocktail offerings.
