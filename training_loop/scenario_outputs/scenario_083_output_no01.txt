Tags: compliance, event_setup, allergens, ID_checks, signage

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Provide an at-a-glance compliance kit: ID flow, allergy labeling, incident log, and escalation tree. Include signage language and a 5-step pre-shift brief.

Venue Context: Outdoor street festival pop-up (1,200 guests, 4-hour window), limited shade, mixed staff from two venues, simple batched menu.

Prompt: We need bulletproof ID checks and clear allergen labeling for two batched cocktails (one contains almond orgeat). Give us the exact setup, roles, scripts, and signage.

Lloyd's Response:

To ensure bulletproof ID checks and clear allergen labeling for your batched cocktails, follow this structured plan:

### Setup and Roles

1. **Bartender**: 
   - Primary role for serving and ID checks.
   - Responsible for verifying age and ensuring allergy information is communicated.

2. **Host/Server**:
   - Greets guests and checks IDs at the entrance.
   - Provides initial allergen information and directs guests to allergen signage.

3. **Barback**:
   - Supports bartenders by restocking and monitoring allergen signage.
   - Ensures allergen labels are visible and updated.

### ID Check Process

- **At Entrance**: Host verifies ID for all guests appearing under 30. Use a UV light scanner if available for added security.
- **At Bar**: Bartender rechecks IDs for guests ordering alcohol.
- **Script**: “May I see your ID, please? We require an ID for all alcohol orders. Thank you for understanding.”

### Allergen Labeling

1. **Cocktail Menu**:
   - Clearly label cocktails with allergens.
   - Example: "Tropical Punch (contains almond, coconut)."

2. **Bar Signage**:
   - Place clear signs at the bar and point of sale indicating allergens.
   - Example Sign: "Please alert staff to any allergies. Our Tropical Punch contains almond."

3. **Scripts for Staff**:
   - Host/Server: “Please let us know if you have any allergies. We have clear signage at the bar for your safety.”
   - Bartender: “Our Tropical Punch contains almond. Do you have any allergies we should be aware of?”

### Summary Checklist

- Assign roles for ID checks and allergen communication.
- Position allergen signage prominently at the bar and entrance.
- Train staff on scripts for consistent communication.
- Conduct regular checks to ensure signage is visible and accurate.
- Run a mock service drill to test ID and allergen protocol effectiveness.

By implementing these measures, you'll enhance safety, compliance, and guest satisfaction.
