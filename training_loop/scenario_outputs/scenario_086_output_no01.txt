Title: Client Request: Bar Layout Plan

Tags: layout, workflow, consultation

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize ergonomic efficiency, collision reduction, and speed of service.

Venue Context: New neighborhood restaurant planning to add a cocktail program with limited space.

Prompt: We’d like your help designing our bar layout. What’s the most efficient setup for our staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To provide tailored advice for your bar layout, I need a bit more context. Could you share:

1. The size and layout of your bar area (dimensions if possible, e.g., length of the bar, back bar space)?
2. The typical service model (e.g., high-volume nightclub, sit-down restaurant, walk-up counter)?

This information will help me offer specific, actionable recommendations for your venue.
