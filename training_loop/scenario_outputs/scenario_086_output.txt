Title: Client Request: Bar Layout Plan

Tags: layout, workflow, consultation

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize ergonomic efficiency, collision reduction, and speed of service.

Venue Context: New neighborhood restaurant planning to add a cocktail program with limited space.

Prompt: We’d like your help designing our bar layout. What’s the most efficient setup for our staff?

Lloyd's Response:

To provide the most effective bar layout design for your staff, I'll need a bit more information to tailor the recommendations accurately. Please clarify the following:

1. **Venue Details**: 
   - What type of venue are you operating (e.g., nightclub, restaurant, cocktail bar)?
   - How many seats or what capacity does your venue have?

2. **Bar Operations**:
   - What is your peak service time and expected volume?
   - How many bartenders are typically on shift during peak times?

Once I have these details, I can give you specific guidance on station setup, reach zones, traffic lanes, and more to enhance efficiency and service speed.
