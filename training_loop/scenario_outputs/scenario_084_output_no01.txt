Title: Pour-Cost Spike & Shrinkage Hunt

Tags: profitability, inventory, variance, training, controls

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on fast variance detection, root-cause tree, and corrective controls. Include blind-count SOP, jigger vs free-pour test, and a 14-day recovery plan.

Venue Context: Downtown lounge seeing pour cost rise from 21% to 27% over 6 weeks; two new hires; weekend bottle-necks; inconsistent comps/voids logging.

Prompt: Build a step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix our pour-cost spike. What should we audit first, what data to pull, and which controls to put in place immediately?

Lloyd's Response:

Here's a structured plan to address your pour-cost spike effectively. This plan prioritizes immediate controls and long-term strategies to stabilize and improve your beverage program's profitability.

### Step-by-Step Plan

**1. Initial Diagnosis:**
   - **Sales vs. Usage Data:** Pull sales reports and compare them with inventory usage data for the past three months. Look for discrepancies that might indicate over-pouring, theft, or wastage.
   - **High-Cost Items:** Identify cocktails with the highest pour costs. Focus on those exceeding your target pour cost range (typically 18-22% for most venues).
   - **Shrinkage Check:** Conduct a surprise inventory count to identify any shrinkage or inventory discrepancies.

**2. Data Collection:**
   - **Inventory Turnover Rates:** Review turnover rates for key spirits and mixers. High turnover might indicate overuse or mismanagement.
   - **POS Data:** Examine POS data for voids, comps, and discounts that might be affecting costs.
   - **Staff Pouring Methods:** Observe bartenders during service to check for consistent pouring techniques and adherence to recipes.

**3. Immediate Controls:**
   - **Portion Control:** Implement jigger training or introduce automated pour systems to ensure consistent pours.
   - **Recipe Standardization:** Ensure all recipes are standardized and followed precisely. Post recipe cards at the bar for easy reference.
   - **Par Level Adjustments:** Adjust par levels based on real usage data to prevent overstocking and potential spoilage.

**4. Long-term Strategies:**
   - **Quarterly Pour Cost Audits:** Establish a routine audit schedule to review pour costs and adjust pricing or recipes as needed.
   - **Menu Engineering:** Regularly evaluate your menu to balance high-cost items with more profitable options. Consider seasonal menu changes to refresh offerings and adjust cost structures.
   - **Staff Training:** Conduct ongoing training to reinforce portion control, upselling techniques, and product knowledge.

**5. Monitoring and Reporting:**
   - **Weekly Inventory Checks:** Implement weekly inventory counts to quickly identify and address discrepancies.
   - **Cost Reports:** Develop a weekly report that tracks pour costs, sales, and inventory variances. Use this data to make informed decisions on pricing and cost adjustments.

**Summary Checklist:**
- Pull and analyze sales and usage data.
- Identify high-cost items and discrepancies.
- Implement immediate controls (jigger use, recipe adherence).
- Establish a regular audit and training schedule.
- Develop ongoing monitoring and reporting systems.

By following this plan, you'll establish a clear path to diagnose the root causes of your pour-cost spike and implement controls to enhance profitability while maintaining guest satisfaction.
