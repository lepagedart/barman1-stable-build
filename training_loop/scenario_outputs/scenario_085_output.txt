Tags: portfolio, menu_engineering, co_marketing, ops_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize supplier tiers/placements, cross-venue prep alignment, and measurable trade support. Include a 12-week rollout calendar and staff incentive plan.

Venue Context: Group with three distinct bars (hotel lobby, rooftop, neighborhood). Partner distributor offers support if we feature two portfolio SKUs in a seasonal menu.

Prompt: Propose a cohesive seasonal menu using the partner’s SKUs that still fits each venue’s style. Outline recipes, prep alignment, pricing, KPI targets, and distributor activation plan.

Lloyd's Response:

To integrate your partner's SKUs into a cohesive seasonal menu that fits each venue's style, we'll focus on creating recipes that leverage existing inventory, streamline operations, and enhance guest experience. Here's a structured plan:

### Menu Design

1. **Cocktail Selections**:
   - **Winter Old Fashioned**: 
     - **Spec**: 2 oz partner's bourbon, 0.5 oz spiced syrup (cinnamon and clove-infused), 2 dashes aromatic bitters.
     - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Rocks glass, large ice cube, orange peel.
     - **Cost Notes**: Ensure bourbon is at a reasonable cost, targeting a 20% pour cost.

   - **Hot Toddy**:
     - **Spec**: 1.5 oz partner's whiskey, 0.5 oz honey, 0.5 oz lemon juice, 3 oz hot water.
     - **Service**: Serve in a mug, garnish with a lemon wheel and cinnamon stick.
     - **Cost Notes**: Use a mid-range whiskey to maintain a 22% pour cost.

   - **Cranberry Mule**:
     - **Spec**: 2 oz partner's vodka, 0.5 oz cranberry juice, 0.5 oz lime juice, top with ginger beer.
     - **Glass/Ice/Garnish**: Copper mug, crushed ice, mint sprig and cranberries.
     - **Cost Notes**: Keep vodka cost-effective to hit a 20% pour cost.

### Prep Alignment

- **Batching**: 
  - **Spiced Syrup**: Prepare in bulk weekly, refrigerate, 2-week shelf life.
  - **Cranberry Juice**: Prep fresh or use high-quality bottled, batch for 3 days.
  
- **Station Setup**: 
  - Ensure efficient station layout for fast build: spirits and syrups in reach zone A, juices in reach zone B.

### Pricing Strategy

- Set cocktail prices to achieve a 20-22% pour cost.
- Monitor guest feedback and adapt pricing based on demand and cost fluctuations.

### KPI Targets

- **Ticket Times**: Aim for sub-2 minute build times during peak hours.
- **Sales Mix**: Target 60% of cocktail sales from the seasonal menu.
- **Guest Satisfaction**: Regular feedback surveys to maintain a 90% satisfaction rate.

### Distributor Activation Plan

- **Quarterly Reviews**: Schedule with distributor to adjust SKUs based on sales data.
- **Incentives**: Leverage distributor promotions to reduce costs on high-volume items.
- **Training**: Conduct staff training sessions focusing on storytelling and upselling techniques for partner SKUs.

### Summary Checklist

1. Finalize and test cocktail recipes with staff.
2. Organize a bartender training session for menu rollout.
3. Set up a meeting with distributors to discuss Q4 incentives.
4. Monitor KPIs weekly, adjust menu as needed.
5. Implement guest feedback systems to ensure ongoing satisfaction.

This plan ensures that the seasonal menu is aligned with your partner's offerings while maintaining operational efficiency and guest satisfaction.
