Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Menu Across Three Venues

Tags: portfolio, menu_engineering, co_marketing, ops_alignment

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Prioritize supplier tiers/placements, cross-venue prep alignment, and measurable trade support. Include a 12-week rollout calendar and staff incentive plan.

Venue Context: Group with three distinct bars (hotel lobby, rooftop, neighborhood). Partner distributor offers support if we feature two portfolio SKUs in a seasonal menu.

Prompt: Propose a cohesive seasonal menu using the partner’s SKUs that still fits each venue’s style. Outline recipes, prep alignment, pricing, KPI targets, and distributor activation plan.
