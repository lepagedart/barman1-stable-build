Title: Saturday Night POS Outage — Keep Service Moving

Tags: technology, ops, speed_of_service, cash_handling, risk

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on offline workflows, redundancy, and reconciliation. Include device & network triage, paper ticket flow, cash/IOU protocol, and end-of-night data merge.

Venue Context: High-volume neighborhood cocktail bar (220 covers, 2 stations, 1 service well), peak Saturday 9–11pm. POS went down mid-service.

Prompt: Our POS died during peak and support ETA is hours. How do we keep taking orders, maintain accuracy, control cash/cards, and reconcile later without wrecking the guest experience?
