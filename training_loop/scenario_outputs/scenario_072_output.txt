Tags: profitability, menu_engineering, pour_cost, supplier_alignment, sku_rationalization

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize profitability levers: priced tiers, batch efficiency, modifier costs, loss/waste controls, and supplier incentives.

Venue Context: High-volume hotel lobby bar with 24 cocktail SKUs, current pour cost 25.8%, comps running high on two signature drinks.

Prompt: We need to reduce cocktail pour cost from ~26% to 22% while improving guest sentiment. What are the fastest menu and workflow changes we can make this month? Include swap/keep lists, cost math examples, and a weekly KPI tracker.

Lloyd's Response:

To reduce the cocktail pour cost from 26% to 22% while enhancing guest sentiment, you'll need to make strategic changes to both your menu and workflow. Here's a practical approach to achieve these goals:

### Menu Changes

1. **Ingredient Swaps**:
   - **Swap:** High-cost spirits for quality mid-tier alternatives. For example, switch from a premium tequila to a well-known mid-tier brand that still resonates with guests.
   - **Keep:** Signature or unique ingredients that define your cocktails and can't be easily replaced.

2. **Recipe Adjustments**:
   - Reduce the amount of high-cost ingredients in cocktails. Adjust recipes to use 0.75 oz of premium spirits instead of 1 oz, complementing with a well-balanced mix of modifiers.
   - Increase the use of house-made syrups and seasonal ingredients that are cost-effective and add perceived value.

3. **Simplified Offerings**:
   - Focus on cocktails that share base ingredients, allowing for bulk purchasing discounts and reducing SKU load.

### Workflow Efficiencies

1. **Batching**:
   - Implement batching for popular cocktails to speed up service and reduce individual pour errors. Ensure that only liquor-based components are batched to maintain quality and shelf life.

2. **Station Setup**:
   - Optimize station layout for minimal movement, ensuring all frequently used items are within arm's reach.

### Cost Math Example

- **Current Margarita**: 
  - 1.5 oz premium tequila ($1.20), 1 oz triple sec ($0.30), fresh lime juice ($0.20), simple syrup ($0.10) = $1.80 cost
  - Sale price $7.00, pour cost ≈ 25.7%
  
- **Adjusted Margarita**:
  - 1 oz mid-tier tequila ($0.80), 1 oz triple sec ($0.30), fresh lime juice ($0.20), simple syrup ($0.10) = $1.40 cost
  - Sale price $7.00, pour cost ≈ 20%

### Weekly KPI Tracker

1. **Pour Cost Analysis**:
   - Track daily pour costs and adjust purchasing based on performance.
   
2. **Inventory Turnover**:
   - Monitor weekly inventory turnover rates to ensure stock levels align with sales.

3. **Guest Feedback**:
   - Collect and review guest feedback weekly to ensure changes positively impact guest sentiment.

4. **Service Speed**:
   - Measure average ticket times during peak hours to ensure workflow adjustments improve speed.

### Swap/Keep List

- **Swap**: 
  - Premium spirits with mid-tier alternatives
  - Branded mixers with house-made options

- **Keep**: 
  - Unique ingredients that define your venue's signature drinks
  - Core spirits with strong brand loyalty among guests

Implement these changes systematically over the next month, monitoring KPIs weekly to ensure you're tracking towards your pour cost and guest sentiment goals. Adjust strategies based on what the data and guest feedback reveal.
