Tags: compliance, event_setup, allergens, ID_checks, signage

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Provide an at-a-glance compliance kit: ID flow, allergy labeling, incident log, and escalation tree. Include signage language and a 5-step pre-shift brief.

Venue Context: Outdoor street festival pop-up (1,200 guests, 4-hour window), limited shade, mixed staff from two venues, simple batched menu.

Prompt: We need bulletproof ID checks and clear allergen labeling for two batched cocktails (one contains almond orgeat). Give us the exact setup, roles, scripts, and signage.

Lloyd's Response:

Implementing a robust ID checking system and clear allergen labeling is crucial for both legal compliance and guest safety. Here's a streamlined plan to ensure both needs are met effectively.

### Setup and Roles

1. **Entrance Protocol**:
   - **ID Check Station**: Set up a dedicated station at the entrance staffed by a trained employee.
   - **Staff Role**: Designate one person as the "ID Checker" whose sole task is to verify IDs. Ensure they are familiar with various ID types and security features.
   - **Verification Tools**: Provide a UV ID checker device and a booklet of valid ID samples.

2. **Bar Station**:
   - **Allergen Information Display**: Post allergen signs visibly on the bar and menu listing ingredients and potential allergens.

### Scripts

1. **ID Checking Script**:
   - "Hello! May I please see your ID?"
   - (Upon verification) "Thank you. Enjoy your time here!"
   - (If ID is invalid or not present) "I'm sorry, but I can't serve you without a valid ID. Thank you for understanding."

2. **Allergen Communication Script**:
   - "Just a heads up, the [Cocktail Name] contains almond orgeat. If you have any allergies, please let us know."

### Signage

1. **ID Check Signage**:
   - **Content**: "ID Required for Entry. Please have your ID ready."
   - **Placement**: At the entrance, visible from the queue.

2. **Allergen Signage**:
   - **Content**: "Allergen Alert! The [Cocktail Name] contains almond orgeat. Please inform our staff of any allergies."
   - **Placement**: On the bar top and menu, in a font that stands out.

### Operational Notes

- **Training**: Conduct a training session for staff on ID verification techniques and allergen awareness.
- **Monitoring**: Assign a manager to periodically oversee ID checks and ensure allergen signs are visible and up-to-date.
- **Feedback Loop**: Encourage staff to report any issues or guest feedback to improve the process.

By setting clear roles, using straightforward scripts, and ensuring visible signage, you can maintain compliance and enhance guest safety efficiently.
