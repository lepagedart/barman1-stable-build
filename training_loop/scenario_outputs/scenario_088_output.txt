Title: POS–Inventory Sync (Light Specs Provided)

Tags: technology, inventory, forecasting, profitability

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on practical integrations and a phased rollout; protect service from tech disruption.

Venue Context: Two-location restaurant group. Wants recipe costing and real-time depletion, but toolset isn’t locked.

Prompt: We want POS and inventory to talk so we can see pour cost live and forecast pars. We’re open to your approach. What should we do first? Which data fields matter most?

Lloyd's Response:

To achieve live pour cost tracking and accurate par forecasting by integrating your POS with inventory management, follow these steps:

### Initial Steps

1. **Audit Current Systems**
   - Review your current POS and inventory management systems to ensure compatibility. Determine if they have integration capabilities or if middleware/API solutions will be needed.

2. **Define Key Objectives**
   - Establish what you want to achieve with the integration (e.g., live pour cost visibility, real-time par adjustments, shrinkage monitoring).

3. **Data Field Mapping**
   - Identify critical data fields that need synchronization:
     - **POS Fields:** Item name, SKU, sale price, time of sale, quantity sold.
     - **Inventory Fields:** Item name, SKU, purchase price, current stock levels, reorder points.

4. **Select Integration Tools**
   - Choose software or service providers that specialize in POS-inventory integrations. Solutions like BevSpot, Partender, or BarVision can facilitate this process.

### Critical Data Fields

- **Sales Data:** Track each item's sales performance, volume sold, and time of transaction.
- **Inventory Levels:** Monitor current stock and set alerts for low inventory.
- **Cost Data:** Record purchase costs to calculate pour costs accurately.
- **Shrinkage Tracking:** Note discrepancies between expected and actual inventory levels to identify potential loss or theft.

### Implement & Test

- **Integration Setup**
  - Configure the chosen integration tool to ensure seamless data flow between systems.
  - Map POS items to inventory SKUs accurately to prevent data mismatches.

- **Testing Phase**
  - Run parallel monitoring for a set period to ensure accuracy in data reporting and system functionality.
  - Adjust settings based on test outcomes to optimize performance.

### Monitoring & Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**
  - Keep software and systems updated to incorporate new features or fix bugs.
- **Staff Training**
  - Train staff to input data accurately and interpret reports effectively.
- **Routine Audits**
  - Schedule regular audits to verify accuracy of data and system performance.

### Summary Checklist

- [ ] Review current systems for compatibility and integration capabilities.
- [ ] Define objectives and desired outcomes for the integration.
- [ ] Map essential data fields for synchronization.
- [ ] Choose an appropriate integration tool or service.
- [ ] Set up and test the integration for accuracy and functionality.
- [ ] Train staff and schedule regular system audits for ongoing accuracy.

By following these steps, you can create a robust system that provides live pour cost tracking and helps forecast inventory needs, enhancing operational efficiency and cost management.
