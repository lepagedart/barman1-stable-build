Title: Distributor-Aligned Seasonal Refresh

Tags: portfolio_matching, cost_control, profit_margins, menu_design, supplier_relationships

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Frame ideas through supplier alignment. Tie each cocktail to a portfolio product, note incentive assumptions, and include a simple cost/price table with target pour %.

Venue Context: Downtown bistro that buys through a single distributor; rep is pushing a set of seasonal SKUs (aperitivo, amaro, rye whiskey, orange liqueur).

Prompt: We want a small seasonal refresh that uses our distributor’s priority SKUs so we can negotiate better pricing. Give us 4 builds that won’t slow service and still feel on-brand.
