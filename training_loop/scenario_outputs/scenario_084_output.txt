Title: Pour-Cost Spike & Shrinkage Hunt

Tags: profitability, inventory, variance, training, controls

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on fast variance detection, root-cause tree, and corrective controls. Include blind-count SOP, jigger vs free-pour test, and a 14-day recovery plan.

Venue Context: Downtown lounge seeing pour cost rise from 21% to 27% over 6 weeks; two new hires; weekend bottle-necks; inconsistent comps/voids logging.

Prompt: Build a step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix our pour-cost spike. What should we audit first, what data to pull, and which controls to put in place immediately?

Lloyd's Response:

To address a spike in pour costs effectively, you need a structured approach to diagnose the problem and implement controls. Here's a step-by-step plan:

### Step 1: Initial Diagnosis
- **Review POS Data:** Pull sales data for the past three months to identify trends. Look for specific cocktails or ingredients with increased usage.
- **Inventory Checks:** Conduct a thorough inventory of all spirits, wines, and modifiers. Compare the actual stock with expected levels based on sales data.
- **Staff Interviews:** Speak with bartenders and managers to gather insights on potential wastage, over-pouring, or theft.

### Step 2: Data Collection
- **Cost of Goods Sold (COGS):** Calculate the COGS for each cocktail. Compare with target pour costs (typically 18-22%) to spot discrepancies.
- **Waste Logs:** Implement or review existing waste logs to track any spillage or spoilage.
- **Vendor Pricing:** Revisit supplier invoices to ensure there haven't been unnoticed price increases.

### Step 3: Identify Issues
- **High-Priced Items:** Identify cocktails with the highest ingredient costs and assess their profitability.
- **Inefficient Recipes:** Look for recipes using uncommon or expensive ingredients that affect margins.
- **Inconsistent Pours:** Audit staff performance for variances in pour sizes or preparation methods.

### Step 4: Implement Immediate Controls
- **Standardized Recipes:** Ensure all bartenders are using standard recipes and portions. Retrain if necessary.
- **Inventory Management:** Set tighter inventory control with regular checks and balances.
- **Portion Control Tools:** Introduce jiggers or automated pourers to maintain consistent serving sizes.
- **Regular Audits:** Schedule weekly inventory audits and monthly pour cost reviews.

### Step 5: Monitoring and Adjustment
- **Daily Tracking:** Monitor daily sales and inventory changes closely for immediate detection of issues.
- **Feedback Loop:** Establish a system for regular feedback from staff on service and operational challenges.
- **Menu Engineering:** Consider revising the menu to remove or adjust low-margin cocktails.

### Summary Checklist
1. Pull and analyze POS and inventory data.
2. Conduct staff interviews for operational insights.
3. Calculate COGS and compare against targets.
4. Identify and address high-cost cocktails and inefficient recipes.
5. Implement tools for portion control and standardized recipes.
6. Schedule regular audits and reviews.

By following this plan, you'll gain clarity on where the pour-cost spikes are occurring and establish controls to prevent future issues, helping protect your margins while maintaining a great guest experience.
