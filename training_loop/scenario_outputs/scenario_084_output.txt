Title: Pour-Cost Spike & Shrinkage Hunt

Tags: profitability, inventory, variance, training, controls

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Focus on fast variance detection, root-cause tree, and corrective controls. Include blind-count SOP, jigger vs free-pour test, and a 14-day recovery plan.

Venue Context: Downtown lounge seeing pour cost rise from 21% to 27% over 6 weeks; two new hires; weekend bottle-necks; inconsistent comps/voids logging.

Prompt: Build a step-by-step plan to diagnose and fix our pour-cost spike. What should we audit first, what data to pull, and which controls to put in place immediately?
