Title: Bar Backlog: Slow Friday Ticket Times

Tags: layout, workflow, speed_of_service, guest_experience

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Emphasize throughput and collision reduction; tighten pass-line and handoff.

Venue Context: Neighborhood cocktail bar, 80 seats, single service well + 1 guest well. POS at bar ends. Recent complaints about 12–15 min ticket times between 8–10pm.

Prompt: We’re seeing a Friday night backlog—drinks are taking too long and the well looks jammed. Can you redesign our station map and rail load-out to speed things up without adding staff?

Lloyd's Response:

Certainly! To address the Friday night backlog and streamline your service, we’ll focus on optimizing your station layout, rail load-out, and workflow. Here's a pragmatic approach:

### Station Map
1. **Designate Roles**: Assign clear roles to each bartender. One should handle the service well for server orders, while the other focuses on guest-facing orders.
2. **Traffic Lanes**: Establish a one-way flow behind the bar to prevent collisions. Use floor tape or signage to guide movement direction.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Place the most frequently used tools and spirits within immediate reach. This includes jiggers, shaking/stirring tools, and top-selling spirits.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Position less frequently used spirits and glassware here.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Store backups, like extra ice and bulk supplies, to reduce clutter.

### Rail Load-out (Left to Right)
- Group spirits by cocktail family (e.g., Vodka, Gin, Rum, Tequila, Whiskey).
- Place modifiers and liqueurs after base spirits.
- Keep bitters, syrups, and garnishes at the end of the rail for easy access.

### Build Path Optimization
1. **Glassware First**: Start with glassware and ice to prep each station.
2. **Spirit Addition**: Add base spirits followed by modifiers.
3. **Mixers and Garnishes**: Complete with mixers and garnishes after shaking/stirring.

### Operational Notes
- **Par Levels**: Ensure par levels for glassware, ice, and garnishes are met before peak hours to prevent restocking delays.
- **Stress Drill**: Conduct a 20-minute drill before peak hours to test throughput and adjust as necessary.

By implementing these changes, you should see a decrease in ticket times and a smoother workflow, helping your team maintain speed without needing additional staff.
