Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Center on compliance: age verification, labeling, off-well storage limits, batch documentation, and staff scripts.

Venue Context: Large patio bar with two satellite stations and frequent private events. New city audit standards just rolled out.

Prompt: Build a compliance-first service plan for our patio: ID checks, batch logs/labels, allergy notation, guest signage, and server scripts. Include a pre-shift compliance checklist and incident escalation flow.

Lloyd's Response:

Here's a comprehensive compliance-first service plan for your patio bar to ensure all operations are within regulatory standards:

### Compliance Service Plan

**1. ID Checks**
   - Train staff to check IDs for every guest appearing under 30. Use a UV light scanner for authenticity verification.
   - Implement a "check at entry" policy with wristbands for verified patrons to streamline orders.

**2. Batch Logs/Labels**
   - Maintain a detailed batch log for every pre-mixed cocktail. Include ingredients, batch date, and use-by date.
   - Label all containers with ABV, allergen information, and batch number. Ensure labels are waterproof and visible.

**3. Allergy Notation**
   - Clearly list allergens on menus and have allergen info readily available for all drinks.
   - Train staff to ask guests about allergies when taking orders. Use a visible allergen alert system for kitchen and bar staff.

**4. Guest Signage**
   - Place clear and visible signage at entry points and service areas, indicating "No Minors," "ID Required," and "Allergy Information Available."
   - Include "Please Drink Responsibly" reminders and emergency contact information.

**5. Server Scripts**
   - Develop scripts for staff to handle ID checks, allergy inquiries, and responsible service reminders.
   - Ensure staff can confidently communicate batch details and allergen information.

### Pre-Shift Compliance Checklist

- [ ] Verify that the patio area is covered by the liquor license and all permits are up-to-date.
- [ ] Ensure all required signage is in place and visible.
- [ ] Check that batch logs are current and labels are intact and legible.
- [ ] Conduct a pre-shift briefing on ID verification and allergy protocol.
- [ ] Confirm all staff have scripts for compliance-related interactions.

### Incident Escalation Flow

1. **Minor Issues (e.g., batch label falls off)**
   - Correct immediately and log the incident.
   - Notify a manager if this occurs repeatedly.

2. **Moderate Issues (e.g., guest allergic reaction)**
   - Provide immediate first aid and call emergency services if needed.
   - Log the incident comprehensively and notify management.

3. **Severe Issues (e.g., serving a minor)**
   - Cease service immediately and remove the minor from the premises.
   - Document the incident, report to regulatory authorities if required, and inform senior management.

By following these steps, your patio bar can operate smoothly while staying compliant with local regulations.
