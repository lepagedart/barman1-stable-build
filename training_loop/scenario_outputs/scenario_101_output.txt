Title: Casual Restaurant without Dedicated Bar Manager

Tags: Inexperienced Bartenders, menu design, Training, implementation, Execution, perceived value, Lack of training program

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: Casual mid-sized restaurant with a neighborhood following. Beer and wine program is established, but the cocktail menu is basic and underperforming. No full-time bar manager — the bar is overseen by the GM, who also handles floor operations.

Prompt: We don’t have a bar manager and our staff mostly serves or pours wine. But I still want a cocktail list that makes money and isn’t embarrassing. Where do we even start?

Lloyd's Response:

To start a profitable and simple cocktail program in a venue where the staff primarily serves or pours wine, focus on creating a streamlined, easy-to-execute menu. Here’s how to get started:

### 1. Simplify and Standardize
- **Choose Simple Cocktails**: Focus on classic cocktails that are easy to make, such as a Gin & Tonic, Vodka Soda, or a basic Margarita. These require minimal prep and are familiar to most guests.
- **Limit the Menu**: Start with 3-5 cocktails to keep the menu manageable and reduce inventory needs.
- **Use Common Ingredients**: Select cocktails that share base spirits and modifiers, minimizing the number of SKUs needed.

### 2. Cost Control
- **Portion Sizes**: Standardize pour sizes to 1.5 oz of base spirit. This helps control costs and maintain consistency.
- **Simple Garnishes**: Use simple, low-cost garnishes like lemon twists or olives that are easy to prepare and have minimal spoilage risk.

### 3. Staff Training
- **Basic Training**: Provide staff with a simple training session on how to correctly measure, pour, and garnish the selected cocktails.
- **Recipe Cards**: Create clear recipe cards that detail steps for each cocktail, ensuring consistency and reducing errors.

### 4. Operational Efficiency
- **Batching**: Consider batching ingredients like simple syrups or citrus to save time during service without sacrificing freshness.
- **Minimal Equipment**: Ensure you have essential tools like jiggers for measuring and shakers or stirring spoons if needed.

### 5. Guest Experience
- **Presentation**: Focus on clean, attractive presentation. Use chilled glassware to enhance the drinking experience without additional cost.
- **Storytelling**: Arm your staff with a few interesting facts or stories about each cocktail to enhance guest engagement.

### Summary Checklist
1. Select 3-5 simple, classic cocktails.
2. Standardize pour sizes and garnishes.
3. Train staff with clear recipe cards and basic techniques.
4. Simplify operations with batching and minimal equipment.
5. Enhance guest experience with presentation and storytelling.

By focusing on simplicity, consistency, and cost control, you can implement a cocktail list that is both profitable and respectable, even with a primarily wine-focused team.
