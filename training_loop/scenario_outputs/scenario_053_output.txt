Tags: layout, workflow, speed_of_service, ergonomics

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Stress-test station setup for ergonomic efficiency and speed.

Venue Context: A luxury hotel wants to reconfigure its poolside bar to serve 250+ guests quickly on hot afternoons.

Prompt: How should we set up our poolside bar stations to keep service fast, staff efficient, and lines short?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your poolside bar stations for fast service and efficiency, focus on a clear layout, strategic equipment placement, and an effective workflow. Here's a practical setup:

### Station Map
- **Designate Roles**: Assign specific roles such as Bartender 1 handling the service well for ticket orders, and Bartender 2 focusing on walk-up guests.
- **Traffic Lanes**: Establish a one-way flow behind the bar to prevent collisions; use clear signage or floor markings.

### Reach Zones
- **Zone A (0–18")**: Keep frequently used tools and ingredients within immediate reach, including jiggers, strainers, and top-selling spirits.
- **Zone B (18–30")**: Place less frequently used items like secondary spirits and backup glassware.
- **Zone C (>30")**: Store bulk supplies, extra ice bins, and cleaning materials out of the immediate work area.

### Rail Loadout
- **Left to Right**: Order the speed rail with the most popular spirits first, followed by mixers. Position jiggers, shakers, and strainers at the center for easy access by both bartenders.

### Build Path
- **FIFO Order**: Follow a first-in, first-out order from glass → ice → spirit → modifier → shake/stir → strain → garnish for efficient builds.

### Prep & Pars
- **Daily Pars**: Set pars for ice, citrus, and syrups, based on expected volume. Regularly restock to avoid mid-service shortages.
- **Label Scheme**: Use a clear labeling system for all prepped ingredients to ensure consistency and minimize errors.

### Collision Controls
- **One-way Lanes**: Implement a directional flow to reduce bartender collisions.
- **No Stand Zones**: Identify areas where bartenders should not stand to avoid blocking others.

### Action Checklist
1. Assign specific roles and establish a clear traffic flow.
2. Arrange tools and ingredients within designated reach zones.
3. Order the speed rail for optimal efficiency and access.
4. Follow a consistent build path for quick drink preparation.
5. Conduct a 20-minute mock service drill to test the setup and make adjustments as needed.

By organizing your poolside bar stations with these principles, you can enhance service speed, maintain efficiency, and keep lines short, ensuring a great experience for guests.
