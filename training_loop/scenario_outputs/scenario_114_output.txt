Title: Winery Tasting Room – Adding Low-ABV Cocktail Program

Tags: layout, technology, compliance, low-abv, batching

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: layout_lens+technology_lens+compliance_lens

Venue Context: Winery tasting room with limited back bar (no full kitchen, small undercounter fridge). Team is wine-trained, limited cocktail experience. Desire for spritz/amaro/vermouth-forward offerings; local ABC rules on batching/labeling apply.

Prompt: Propose a low-ABV cocktail mini-program (4–6 drinks) aligned with a winery tasting context. Include station layout, glassware/rack plan, minimal-equipment batching, POS buttons/modifiers, and compliant batch labels/logs. Prioritize speed and staff learnability while keeping brand voice on the wine side.
