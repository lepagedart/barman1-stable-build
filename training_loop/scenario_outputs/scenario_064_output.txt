Lloyd's Response:

To effectively train your staff on the new tequila portfolio while aligning with brand goals and ensuring easy adoption, let's structure the training session into three parts: Education, Practical Application, and Brand Alignment.

### Training Session Structure

#### 1. Education
- **Tequila Basics**: 
  - Briefly explain the tequila production process (agave types, fermentation, distillation).
  - Differentiate between tequila types (Blanco, Reposado, Añejo, Extra Añejo). 
  - Discuss flavor profiles and how they fit into your venue's offerings.
- **Portfolio Overview**: 
  - Introduce each tequila in your portfolio, highlighting unique selling points and flavor notes.
  - Discuss the rationale behind choosing these tequilas for your brand.

#### 2. Practical Application
- **Tasting Session**: 
  - Conduct a guided tasting for each tequila, emphasizing tasting notes and potential cocktail pairings.
  - Encourage staff to describe what they taste, enhancing their confidence in discussing these spirits with guests.
- **Signature Cocktails**:
  - Demonstrate 2-3 signature cocktails from the menu featuring the tequila portfolio.
  - Allow staff to practice making these drinks, focusing on consistency and technique.
  - Discuss any prep or batching strategies relevant to these cocktails.

#### 3. Brand Alignment
- **Brand Storytelling**:
  - Share the brand's story and how tequila fits into your overall concept.
  - Equip bartenders with engaging stories about each tequila to share with guests, enhancing their experience.
- **Upselling Techniques**:
  - Train staff on how to suggest tequila cocktails or neat pours, using customer cues.
  - Discuss pricing strategies and how to align recommendations with guest preferences.

### Operational Notes
- **Training Duration**: 2-3 hours, ensuring enough time for both education and hands-on practice.
- **Materials**: Tasting mats, product sheets, cocktail recipe cards, and any necessary bar tools.
- **Follow-up**: Schedule a brief recap session or quiz a week later to reinforce knowledge and address any questions.

### Summary Checklist
1. Prepare educational materials and tasting kits.
2. Conduct the session with a focus on engagement and practical skills.
3. Equip staff with storytelling and upselling techniques.
4. Schedule a follow-up session to reinforce learning.
5. Monitor service to ensure smooth implementation of training.

This structure ensures that your staff is knowledgeable, confident, and ready to present your tequila offerings in a way that aligns with your brand's goals and enhances the guest experience.
