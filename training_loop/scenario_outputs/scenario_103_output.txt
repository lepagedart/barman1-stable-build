Title: Cafe to Bar Conversion

Tags: Efficiency, setup constraints, Menu design, venue alignment, batching

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Use more concise operational language. Prioritize prep strategies over storytelling.

Venue Context: A coffee shop that becomes a bar after 4pm using the same counter and staff. No dedicated bar setup or ice machine.

Prompt: We’re running evening cocktail service out of our café. The transition is bumpy and we’re not profitable yet. I need a drink menu that makes sense for this space and workflow. What should I change?

Lloyd's Response:

To optimize your evening cocktail service and enhance profitability, consider a streamlined menu that aligns with your café's existing setup and workflow. Here's a practical strategy:

### Menu Design
- **Focus on Core Families**: Limit your menu to 4-5 cocktail families like sours, highballs, and old fashioned variants. This keeps the menu diverse yet manageable.
- **Re-usable Ingredients**: Use ingredients that overlap with your café’s existing inventory where possible. For instance, leverage syrups or garnishes already in use for other beverages.
- **Low-ABV Options**: Include a couple of low-ABV or no-alcohol mocktails to cater to all guests and utilize ingredients like teas or fresh juices.

### Example Menu Items
1. **Classic Sour**
   - Spec: 2 oz bourbon, 0.75 oz lemon juice, 0.5 oz simple syrup
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Rocks / Old-fashioned glass / Lemon wheel
   - Method: Shake with ice, strain
   - Cost Notes: Low-cost components, high margin

2. **Refreshing Highball**
   - Spec: 1.5 oz gin, 0.5 oz lime cordial, top with soda
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Highball / Collins glass / Lime wedge
   - Method: Build in glass over ice
   - Cost Notes: Uses base spirits, high turnover items

3. **Herbal Old Fashioned**
   - Spec: 2 oz whiskey, 0.25 oz herbal liqueur, 2 dashes bitters
   - Ice / Glass / Garnish: Large cube / Rocks glass / Orange twist
   - Method: Stir with ice, strain over fresh ice
   - Cost Notes: Elevated with a premium liqueur, slightly higher cost

### Operational Adjustments
- **Batching**: Consider batching simple syrup or juice mixes during prep to speed up service.
- **Station Setup**: Organize your station to keep high-turnover ingredients within immediate reach (Zone A).
- **Training**: Ensure staff are trained to execute the menu efficiently and understand the flavor profiles to suggest upsells.

### Profitability Considerations
- **Pricing Strategy**: Ensure pricing reflects both the ingredient costs and the operational effort. Aim for a 20-25% pour cost.
- **Monitoring**: Track sales and adjust the menu based on what’s popular or underperforming.

By focusing on a concise menu and aligning it with your café's existing workflow, you should see improvements in service smoothness and profitability.
