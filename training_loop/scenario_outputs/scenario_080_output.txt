Title: Pop-Up Wedding Bar: Minimal Power, Max Throughput

Tags: event_setup, layout, speed_of_service, batching, contingencies

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: Event Setup + Layout lenses. Focus on stations, kegged/dispensed options, ice/mixer logistics, and backup plans.

Venue Context: Outdoor wedding, 280 guests, generator power only, limited ice storage, 3 bartenders and 1 floater.

Prompt: Design a pop-up bar that keeps lines <6 minutes at peak. Specify: station map (ASCII), roles, 3-drink focused menu (pre-batch math, still/kegged options), ice/mixer totals and cadence, glassware vs premium disposables, contingency protocols (ice/mixer shortfalls, staff call-out), pre-shift briefing, and a 5-step teardown plan.

Lloyd's Response:

To ensure efficient service and maintain lines under 6 minutes at a pop-up bar, a streamlined setup with clear roles, an optimized menu, and contingency protocols is essential. Hereâ€™s a detailed plan to achieve these goals:

### Station Map
```
  | Ice Bin | Spirits | Pre-batch Jugs | Garnishes | POS |
```

### Staffing Roles
- **Bartender 1**: Primarily handles spirits and pre-batched cocktails.
- **Bartender 2**: Focuses on garnishes and final touches.
- **Runner/Support**: Manages ice restocking, glassware, and disposables.

### 3-Drink Menu
1. **Classic Spritz**
   - Spec: Aperol (pre-batched), Prosecco, soda water
   - Serve: Wine glass with ice, orange slice garnish
   - Pre-batch: Mix Aperol and soda in a 2:1 ratio, keg if possible for speed.

2. **Gin & Tonic**
   - Spec: Gin, tonic water
   - Serve: Highball glass with ice, lime wedge
   - Pre-batch: Optionally keg tonic for rapid dispensing.

3. **Whiskey Lemonade**
   - Spec: Bourbon (pre-batched), fresh lemonade
   - Serve: Rocks glass with ice, lemon wheel
   - Pre-batch: Combine bourbon and lemonade, use still or kegged for speed.

### Ice/Mixer Totals & Cadence
- **Ice**: Estimate 1.5 lbs per drink. Prepare for 500 lbs for the event; restock every 20 minutes.
- **Mixers**: Stock 1.5x the necessary amount based on batch volume. Restock every 30 minutes.

### Glassware vs. Premium Disposables
- Use glassware for a premium feel; keep a reserve of premium disposables for high volume or glassware shortfalls.

### Contingency Protocols
- **Ice Shortfall**: Have an agreement with a local supplier for emergency deliveries.
- **Mixer Shortfall**: Store additional concentrate syrups and soda water to mix on-site.
- **Staff Call-Out**: Cross-train staff to handle multiple roles and have a standby list of on-call staff.

### Pre-Shift Briefing
- **Objectives**: Ensure all staff are clear on roles and expectations.
- **Drink Specs**: Review menu and batch recipes.
- **Service Flow**: Emphasize the importance of quick, friendly service and maintaining cleanliness.

### 5-Step Teardown Plan
1. **Collect Glassware/Disposables**: Clear all service areas immediately post-event.
2. **Inventory Count**: Record remaining stock and ice levels for future planning.
3. **Equipment Cleaning**: Ensure all tools and stations are cleaned and reset.
4. **Waste Disposal**: Properly dispose of any waste and recyclables.
5. **Feedback Session**: Brief team meeting to discuss performance and improvements.

By following this structured plan, the pop-up bar can efficiently manage high traffic while maintaining service quality and minimizing wait times.
