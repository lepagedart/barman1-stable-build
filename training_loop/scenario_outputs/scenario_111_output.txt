Title: Multi-Property Hotel Group – Standardized Bar Playbook

Tags: portfolio, financials, technology, multi-location, training

Scenario Type: Training

System Mod: portfolio_lens+financials_lens+technology_lens

Venue Context: Regional hotel group (8 properties: urban + resort). Mixed bar formats (lobby bars, rooftop, pool bars). Existing POS is Lightspeed at 6 sites, Toast at 2; basic inventory counts monthly; no unified spec book.

Prompt: Design a standardized, cross-property bar program that keeps local flair but unifies specs, costing, and reporting. We need: (1) a core cocktail list with allowed local swaps, (2) a pricing ladder and target pour cost ranges by market, (3) a POS/inventory integration plan that works across two POS vendors, and (4) how to leverage supplier portfolio incentives without locking out local heroes. Deliver a rollout plan and a 60-day training cadence.

Lloyd's Response:

To create a standardized yet flexible bar program for your hotel group, we’ll focus on balancing consistency with local character and optimizing operational efficiency. Here's a comprehensive plan:

### 1. Core Cocktail List with Local Swaps
- **Core Cocktails**: Select five signature cocktails that embody classic and popular styles. Each should have room for a local ingredient swap:
  - **Classic Margarita**: Tequila, Triple Sec, Lime Juice, Agave Syrup
    - Local Swap: Substitute Triple Sec with a regionally popular fruit liqueur.
  - **Old Fashioned**: Bourbon, Simple Syrup, Angostura Bitters
    - Local Swap: Use a local bitters or a unique syrup (e.g., maple if available).
  - **Negroni**: Gin, Campari, Sweet Vermouth
    - Local Swap: Swap gin with a local craft spirit.
  - **Mojito**: White Rum, Lime Juice, Mint, Simple Syrup, Soda Water
    - Local Swap: Infuse the rum with local herbs or spices.
  - **Espresso Martini**: Vodka, Coffee Liqueur, Fresh Espresso
    - Local Swap: Use a locally roasted coffee brand.

- **Execution Notes**: 
  - Batch core elements where possible (e.g., simple syrups) to maintain consistency.
  - Ensure each venue maintains a list of approved local swaps to simplify training and ordering.

### 2. Pricing Ladder and Target Pour Cost Ranges
- **Pricing Tiers**:
  - Urban Properties: Premium pricing to match market demand. Target pour cost: 18-20%.
  - Resort Properties: Slightly lower pricing to encourage volume. Target pour cost: 20-22%.
  
- **Implementation**:
  - Conduct a market analysis to set competitive pricing.
  - Adjust based on local alcohol taxes and guest demographics.

### 3. POS/Inventory Integration Plan
- **POS Integration**:
  - Use existing Lightspeed and Toast systems to harmonize inventory tracking.
  - Develop a middleware solution or select a third-party app to unify reporting across systems.
  - Standardize product codes and naming conventions across both systems for clarity.

- **Inventory Management**:
  - Shift to bi-weekly counts to improve accuracy.
  - Train staff on input consistency and spot-check procedures.

### 4. Leveraging Supplier Portfolio Incentives
- **Supplier Strategy**:
  - Negotiate with suppliers to include local hero products in their portfolios.
  - Set up quarterly reviews to assess performance and adjust incentives.
  - Balance purchases to meet incentives without excluding local favorites by setting clear SKU limits.

### Rollout Plan and 60-Day Training Cadence
- **Rollout Plan**:
  1. **Week 1-2**: Finalize core cocktail specs, local swaps, and pricing strategy.
  2. **Week 3-4**: Implement POS updates and conduct initial staff training on systems and cocktails.
  3. **Week 5-6**: Begin new inventory procedures and integrate supplier incentives.
  4. **Week 7-8**: Monitor operations, receive feedback, and adjust based on initial data.

- **Training Cadence**:
  - **Initial Training (Weeks 1-4)**: Focus on cocktail preparation, POS use, and inventory processes.
  - **Follow-Up Training (Weeks 5-8)**: Emphasize consistency, troubleshoot issues, and adjust based on feedback.
  - **Ongoing Education**: Monthly sessions on local swap creativity and upselling techniques.

### Summary Checklist
- Establish core cocktail specs and local swaps.
- Set pricing tiers and target pour costs.
- Integrate POS systems for unified reporting.
- Balance supplier incentives with local offerings.
- Implement rollout and training plan within 60 days.

This approach ensures operational efficiency and allows each property to maintain its unique local flavor.
